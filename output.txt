before we proceed any further hear me speak
speak speak
you are all resolved rather to die than to famish
resolved resolved
first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people
we knowt we knowt
let us kill him and well have corn at our own price
ist a verdict
one word good citizens
we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
would yield us but the superfluity while it were
wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely
afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance our
sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with
speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge
would you proceed especially against caius marcius
consider you what services he has done for his country
very well and could be content to give him good
report fort but that he pays himself with being proud
nay but speak not maliciously
i say unto you what he hath done famously he did
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud which he
is even till the altitude of his virtue
what he cannot help in his nature you account a
vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous
if i must not i need not be barren of accusations
he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition
what shouts are these the other side o the city
come come
soft who comes here
worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always loved
the people
what works my countrymen in hand where go you
with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you
our business is not unknown to the senate they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do
which now well show em in deeds they say poor
have strong arms too
why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
will you undo yourselves
we cannot sir we are undone already
i tell you friends most charitable care
have the patricians of you for your wants
your suffering in this dearth you may as well
strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
against the roman state whose course will on
the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
of more strong link asunder than can ever
appear in your impediment for the dearth
the gods not the patricians make it and
your knees to them not arms must help alack
you are transported by calamity
thither where more attends you and you slander
the helms o the state who care for you like fathers
when you curse them as enemies
care for us true indeed they neer cared for us
crammed with grain make edicts for usury to
support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain
the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and
theres all the love they bear us
either you must
confess yourselves wondrous malicious
or be accused of folly i shall tell you
but since it serves my purpose i will venture
to stale t a little more
you deliver
there was a time when all the bodys members
that only like a gulf it did remain
i the midst o the body idle and unactive
still cupboarding the viand never bearing
like labour with the rest where the other instruments
did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
and mutually participate did minister
unto the appetite and affection common
of the whole body the belly answerd
well sir what answer made the belly
sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile
which neer came from the lungs but even thus
for look you i may make the belly smile
as well as speakit tauntingly replied
to the discontented members the mutinous parts
that envied his receipt even so most fitly
as you malign our senators for that
they are not such as you
your bellys answer what
the kinglycrowned head the vigilant eye
the counsellor heart the arm our soldier
our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
with other muniments and petty helps
in this our fabric if that they
what then
fore me this fellow speaks what then what then
should by the cormorant belly be restraind
who is the sink o the body
well what then
the former agents if they did complain
what could the belly answer
i will tell you
if youll bestow a smallof what you have little
patience awhile youll hear the bellys answer
yere long about it
note me this good friend
your most grave belly was deliberate
true is it my incorporate friends quoth he
that i receive the general food at first
which you do live upon and fit it is
because i am the storehouse and the shop
i send it through the rivers of your blood
even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain
and through the cranks and offices of man
the strongest nerves and small inferior veins
from me receive that natural competency
you my good friendsthis says the belly mark me
ay sir well well
though all at once cannot
see what i do deliver out to each
yet i can make my audit up that all
from me do back receive the flour of all
and leave me but the bran what say you tot
the senators of rome are this good belly
and you the mutinous members for examine
their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
touching the weal o the common you shall find
no public benefit which you receive
but it proceeds or comes from them to you
and no way from yourselves what do you think
you the great toe of this assembly
i the great toe why the great toe
for that being one o the lowest basest poorest
thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
leadst first to win some vantage
rome and her rats are at the point of battle
the one side must have bale
hail noble marcius
thanks whats the matter you dissentious rogues
that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
make yourselves scabs
we have ever your good word
he that will give good words to thee will flatter
beneath abhorring what would you have you curs
that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you
the other makes you proud he that trusts to you
where he should find you lions finds you hares
than is the coal of fire upon the ice
or hailstone in the sun your virtue is
to make him worthy whose offence subdues him
and curse that justice did it
who deserves greatness
deserves your hate and your affections are
a sick mans appetite who desires most that
which would increase his evil he that depends
upon your favours swims with fins of lead
and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye
with every minute you do change a mind
and call him noble that was now your hate
him vile that was your garland whats the matter
that in these several places of the city
you cry against the noble senate who
under the gods keep you in awe which else
would feed on one another whats their seeking
for corn at their own rates whereof they say
the city is well stored
hang em they say
theyll sit by the fire and presume to know
whats done i the capitol whos like to rise
who thrives and who declines side factions
and give out
conjectural marriages making parties strong
and feebling such as stand not in their liking
below their cobbled shoes they say theres
grain enough
would the nobility lay aside their ruth
and let me use my sword ill make a quarry
with thousands of these quarterd slaves as high
as i could pick my lance
nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
for though abundantly they lack discretion
yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you
what says the other troop
they said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs
that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
they vented their complainings which being answerd
and a petition granted them a strange one
to break the heart of generosity
and make bold power look palethey threw their caps
as they would hang them on the horns o the moon
shouting their emulation
what is granted them
five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
sicinius velutus and i know notsdeath
the rabble should have first unroofd the city
win upon power and throw forth greater themes
for insurrections arguing
this is strange
go get you home you fragments
wheres caius marcius
the news is sir the volsces are in arms
our musty superfluity see our best elders
marcius tis true that you have lately told us
the volsces are in arms
they have a leader
tullus aufidius that will put you to t
i sin in envying his nobility
and were i any thing but what i am
i would wish me only he
you have fought together
were half to half the world by the ears and he
upon my party ild revolt to make
that i am proud to hunt
then worthy marcius
attend upon cominius to these wars
it is your former promise
sir it is
and i am constant titus lartius thou
shalt see me once more strike at tullus face
what art thou stiff standst out
no caius marcius
ill lean upon one crutch and fight with tother
ere stay behind this business
o truebred
your company to the capitol where i know
our greatest friends attend us
noble marcius
the volsces have much corn take these rats thither
to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners
was ever man so proud as is this marcius
he has no equal
when we were chosen tribunes for the people
markd you his lip and eyes
nay but his taunts
being moved he will not spare to gird the gods
bemock the modest moon
too proud to be so valiant
such a nature
tickled with good success disdains the shadow
his insolence can brook to be commanded
under cominius
fame at the which he aims
in whom already hes well graced can not
better be held nor more attaind than by
shall be the generals fault though he perform
to the utmost of a man and giddy censure
will then cry out of marcius o if he
had borne the business
besides if things go well
opinion that so sticks on marcius shall
of his demerits rob cominius
half all cominius honours are to marcius
though marcius earned them not and all his faults
to marcius shall be honours though indeed
in aught he merit not
lets hence and hear
how the dispatch is made and in what fashion
more than his singularity he goes
upon this present action
lets along
so your opinion is aufidius
that they of rome are entered in our counsels
and know how we proceed
is it not yours
what ever have been thought on in this state
that could be brought to bodily act ere rome
had circumvention tis not four days gone
i have the letter here yes here it is
they have pressd a power but it is not known
the people mutinous and it is rumourd
cominius marcius your old enemy
who is of rome worse hated than of you
and titus lartius a most valiant roman
these three lead on this preparation
consider of it
our armys in the field
we never yet made doubt but rome was ready
to answer us
nor did you think it folly
to keep your great pretences veild till when
they needs must show themselves which
in the hatching
it seemd appeard to rome by the discovery
we shall be shortend in our aim which was
to take in many towns ere almost rome
should know we were afoot
noble aufidius
if they set down before s for the remove
bring your army but i think youll find
theyve not prepared for us
o doubt not that
i speak from certainties nay more
some parcels of their power are forth already
and only hitherward i leave your honours
if we and caius marcius chance to meet
tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
till one can do no more
the gods assist you
and keep your honours safe
farewell
farewell
farewell
i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love when yet he was but
tenderbodied and the only son of my womb when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when
for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding i considering
how honour would become such a person that it was
no better than picturelike to hang by the wall if
renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel
war i sent him from whence he returned his brows
bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man
but had he died in the business madam how then
then his good report should have been my son i
therein would have found issue hear me profess
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action
madam the lady valeria is come to visit you
beseech you give me leave to retire myself
indeed you shall not
methinks i hear hither your husbands drum
see him pluck aufidius down by the hair
come on you cowards you were got in fear
with his maild hand then wiping forth he goes
like to a harvestman thats taskd to mow
or all or lose his hire
his bloody brow o jupiter no blood
away you fool it more becomes a man
when she did suckle hector lookd not lovelier
than hectors forehead when it spit forth blood
at grecian sword contemning tell valeria
we are fit to bid her welcome
heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius
hell beat aufidius head below his knee
and tread upon his neck
my ladies both good day to you
sweet madam
i am glad to see your ladyship
how do you both you are manifest housekeepers
what are you sewing here a fine spot in good
faith how does your little son
i thank your ladyship well good madam
he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than
look upon his schoolmaster
very pretty boy o my troth i looked upon him o
confirmed countenance i saw him run after a gilded
again and after it again and over and over he
comes and again catched it again or whether his
fall enraged him or how twas he did so set his
teeth and tear it o i warrant it how he mammocked
it
one on s fathers moods

threshold till my lord return from the wars

my prayers but i cannot go thither

down before their city corioli they nothing doubt

on mine honour and so i pray go with us

yonder comes news a wager they have met
my horse to yours no
tis done
agreed
say has our general met the enemy
they lie in view but have not spoke as yet
so the good horse is mine
ill buy him of you
for half a hundred years summon the town
how far off lie these armies
within this mile and half
then shall we hear their larum and they ours
now mars i prithee make us quick in work
that we with smoking swords may march from hence
to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast
tutus aufidius is he within your walls
no nor a man that fears you less than he
thats lesser than a little
hark our drums
are bringing forth our youth well break our walls
which yet seem shut we have but pinnd with rushes
theyll open of themselves
hark you far off
there is aufidius list what work he makes
amongst your cloven army
o they are at it
their noise be our instruction ladders ho
they fear us not but issue forth their city
now put your shields before your hearts and fight
with hearts more proof than shields advance
they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
he that retires ill take him for a volsce
and he shall feel mine edge
all the contagion of the south light on you
you shames of rome you herd ofboils and plagues
plaster you oer that you may be abhorrd
further than seen and one infect another
against the wind a mile you souls of geese
that bear the shapes of men how have you run
from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell
all hurt behind backs red and faces pale
with flight and agued fear mend and charge home
or by the fires of heaven ill leave the foe
if youll stand fast well beat them to their wives
as they us to our trenches followed
tis for the followers fortune widens them
foolhardiness not i
nor i
see they have shut him in
to the pot i warrant him
what is become of marcius
slain sir doubtless
following the fliers at the very heels
with them he enters who upon the sudden
to answer all the city
o noble fellow
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
a carbuncle entire as big as thou art
were not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldier
even to catos wish not fierce and terrible
only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
the thunderlike percussion of thy sounds
thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world
were feverous and did tremble
look sir
otis marcius
lets fetch him off or make remain alike
this will i carry to rome
and i this
a murrain ont i took this for silver
see here these movers that do prize their hours
at a crackd drachm cushions leaden spoons
irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would
bury with those that wore them these base slaves
and hark what noise the general makes to him
there is the man of my souls hate aufidius
convenient numbers to make good the city
whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste
to help cominius
worthy sir thou bleedst
thy exercise hath been too violent for
a second course of fight
sir praise me not
the blood i drop is rather physical
i will appear and fight
now the fair goddess fortune
fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
misguide thy opposers swords bold gentleman
prosperity be thy page
thy friend no less
than those she placeth highest so farewell
thou worthiest marcius
go sound thy trumpet in the marketplace
call thither all the officers o the town
we are come off
like romans neither foolish in our stands
we shall be charged again whiles we have struck
by interims and conveying gusts we have heard
the charges of our friends ye roman gods
lead their successes as we wish our own
that both our powers with smiling
fronts encountering
may give you thankful sacrifice
thy news
the citizens of corioli have issued
i saw our party to their trenches driven
and then i came away
though thou speakst truth
methinks thou speakst not well
how long ist since
above an hour my lord
how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
and bring thy news so late
spies of the volsces
held me in chase that i was forced to wheel
three or four miles about else had i sir
half an hour since brought my report
whos yonder
that does appear as he were flayd o gods
he has the stamp of marcius and i have
beforetime seen him thus
the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
more than i know the sound of marcius tongue
from every meaner man
come i too late
ay if you come not in the blood of others
but mantled in your own
o let me clip ye
in arms as sound as when i wood in heart
as merry as when our nuptial day was done
and tapers burnd to bedward
flower of warriors
how is it with titus lartius
condemning some to death and some to exile
ransoming him or pitying threatening the other
holding corioli in the name of rome
even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
to let him slip at will
where is that slave
which told me they had beat you to your trenches
where is he call him hither
let him alone
the common filea plague tribunes for them
the mouse neer shunnd the cat as they did budge
from rascals worse than they
but how prevaild you
will the time serve to tell i do not think
where is the enemy are you lords o the field
if not why cease you till you are so
marcius
we have at disadvantage fought and did
retire to win our purpose
how lies their battle know you on which side
they have placed their men of trust
as i guess marcius
their bands i the vaward are the antiates
of their best trust oer them aufidius
their very heart of hope
i do beseech you
by all the battles wherein we have fought
by the blood we have shed together by the vows
we have made to endure friends that you directly
set me against aufidius and his antiates
and that you not delay the present but
filling the air with swords advanced and darts
we prove this very hour
though i could wish
you were conducted to a gentle bath
and balms applied to you yet dare i never
that best can aid your action
those are they
that most are willing if any such be here
as it were sin to doubtthat love this painting
wherein you see me smeard if any fear
lesser his person than an ill report
if any think brave death outweighs bad life
and that his countrys dearer than himself
let him alone or so many so minded
wave thus to express his disposition
and follow marcius
o me alone make you a sword of me
if these shows be not outward which of you
but is four volsces none of you but is
able to bear against the great aufidius
a shield as hard as his a certain number
though thanks to all must i select
shall bear the business in some other fight
as cause will be obeyd please you to march
and four shall quickly draw out my command
which men are best inclined
make good this ostentation and you shall
divide in all with us
as i have set them down if i do send dispatch
we cannot keep the town
fear not our care sir
hence and shut your gates upons
our guider come to the roman camp conduct us
ill fight with none but thee for i do hate thee
worse than a promisebreaker
not afric owns a serpent i abhor
more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot
let the first budger die the others slave
and the gods doom him after
if i fly marcius
holloa me like a hare
within these three hours tullus
alone i fought in your corioli walls
wherein thou seest me maskd for thy revenge
wrench up thy power to the highest
wert thou the hector
that was the whip of your braggd progeny
thou shouldst not scape me here
officious and not valiant you have shamed me
in your condemned seconds
if i should tell thee oer this thy days work
where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
where great patricians shall attend and shrug
i the end admire where ladies shall be frighted
and gladly quaked hear more where the
dull tribunes
that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
shall say against their hearts we thank the gods
our rome hath such a soldier
yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast
having fully dined before
o general
hadst thou beheld
who has a charter to extol her blood
when she does praise me grieves me i have done
as you have done thats what i can induced
he that has but effected his good will
hath overtaen mine act
you shall not be
the grave of your deserving rome must know
worse than a theft no less than a traducement
to hide your doings and to silence that
which to the spire and top of praises vouchd
in sign of what you are not to reward
what you have donebefore our army hear me
i have some wounds upon me and they smart
to hear themselves rememberd
should they not
well might they fester gainst ingratitude
and tent themselves with death of all the horses
whereof we have taen good and good store of all
the treasure in this field achieved and city
we render you the tenth to be taen forth
before the common distribution at
your only choice
i thank you general
but cannot make my heart consent to take
and stand upon my common part with those
that have beheld the doing
may these same instruments which you profane
never sound more when drums and trumpets shall
i the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
made all of falsefaced soothing
when steel grows soft as the parasites silk
let him be made a coverture for the wars
no more i say for that i have not washd
my nose that bled or foild some debile wretch
which without note heres many else have done
you shout me forth
in acclamations hyperbolical
as if i loved my little should be dieted
in praises sauced with lies
too modest are you
more cruel to your good report than grateful
if gainst yourself you be incensed well put you
like one that means his proper harm in manacles
then reason safely with you therefore be it known
as to us to all the world that caius marcius
my noble steed known to the camp i give him
with all his trim belonging and from this time
for what he did before corioli call him
with all the applause and clamour of the host
caius marcius coriolanus bear
the addition nobly ever
caius marcius coriolanus
i will go wash
and when my face is fair you shall perceive
i mean to stride your steed and at all times
to undercrest your good addition
to the fairness of my power
so to our tent
where ere we do repose us we will write
to rome of our success you titus lartius
the best with whom we may articulate
for their own good and ours
i shall my lord
the gods begin to mock me i that now
refused most princely gifts am bound to beg
of my lord general
taket tis yours what ist
i sometime lay here in corioli
he cried to me i saw him prisoner
but then aufidius was within my view
to give my poor host freedom
o well beggd
were he the butcher of my son he should
be free as is the wind deliver him titus
marcius his name
by jupiter forgot
i am weary yea my memory is tired
have we no wine here
the blood upon your visage dries tis time
the town is taen
twill be deliverd back on good condition
condition
i would i were a roman for i cannot
being a volsce be that i am condition
what good condition can a treaty find
i the part that is at mercy five times marcius
and wouldst do so i think should we encounter
as often as we eat by the elements
if eer again i meet him beard to beard
hath not that honour int it had for where
i thought to crush him in an equal force
true sword to sword ill potch at him some way
or wrath or craft may get him
hes the devil
bolder though not so subtle my valours poisond
with only suffering stain by him for him
being naked sick nor fane nor capitol
the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice
embarquements all of fury shall lift up
their rotten privilege and custom gainst
at home upon my brothers guard even there
against the hospitable canon would i
wash my fierce hand ins heart go you to the city
learn how tis held and what they are that must
be hostages for rome
will not you go
tis south the city millsbring me word thither
how the world goes that to the pace of it
i may spur on my journey
i shall sir
the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
good or bad
not according to the prayer of the people for they
love not marcius
nature teaches beasts to know their friends
pray you who does the wolf love
the lamb
ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
noble marcius
hes a lamb indeed that baes like a bear
hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two
well sir
in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two
have not in abundance
hes poor in no one fault but stored with all
especially in pride
and topping all others in boasting
censured here in the city i mean of us o the
righthand file do you
why how are we censured
because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry
well well sir well
why tis no great matter for a very little thief of
give your dispositions the reins and be angry at
your pleasures at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for
being proud
we do it not alone sir
i know you can do very little alone for your helps
are many or else your actions would grow wondrous
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks
and make but an interior survey of your good selves
o that you could
what then sir
why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as
any in rome
menenius you are known well enough too
i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
tiber int said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike
upon too trivial motion one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as
you arei cannot call you lycurgusesif the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely i make a
crooked face at it i cant say your worships have
delivered the matter well when i find the ass in
though i must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces if you see this in
the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known
well enough too what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character if i be
known well enough too
come sir come we know you well enough
you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience when you are hearing a
matter between party and party if you chance to be
pinched with the colic you make faces like
mummers set up the bloody flag against all
patience and in roaring for a chamberpot
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
cause is calling both the parties knaves you are
a pair of strange ones
come come you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the capitol
our very priests must become mockers if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when
you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the
wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers
cushion or to be entombed in an asss pack
saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud
who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors
since deucalion though peradventure some of the
best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to
infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
how now my as fair as noble ladiesand the moon
were she earthly no noblerwhither do you follow
your eyes so fast
honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for
the love of juno lets go
ha marcius coming home
ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous
approbation
take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo
marcius coming home
naytis true
another his wife another and i think theres one
at home for you
me
yes certain theres a letter for you i sawt
a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven
years health in which time i will make a lip at
galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative
of no better report than a horsedrench is he
not wounded he was wont to come home wounded
o no no no
o he is wounded i thank the gods fort
victory in his pocket the wounds become him
with the oaken garland
has he disciplined aufidius soundly
titus lartius writes they fought together but
aufidius got off
an he had stayed by him i would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold
thats in them is the senate possessed of this
good ladies lets go yes yes yes the senate
has letters from the general wherein he gives my
action outdone his former deeds doubly
in troth theres wondrous things spoke of him
wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his
true purchasing
the gods grant them true
true pow wow
true ill be sworn they are true
where is he wounded
god save your good worships marcius is coming
i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people when he shall
stand for his place he received in the repulse of
tarquin seven hurts i the body
one i the neck and two i the thightheres
nine that i know
he had before this last expedition twentyfive
wounds upon him
hark the trumpets
death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie
which being advanced declines and then men die
know rome that all alone marcius did fight
with fame a name to caius marcius these
in honour follows coriolanus
welcome to rome renowned coriolanus
welcome to rome renowned coriolanus
pray now no more
look sir your mother
o
you have i know petitiond all the gods
for my prosperity
nay my good soldier up
my gentle marcius worthy caius and
by deedachieving honour newly named
what is itcoriolanus must i call thee
but o thy wife
my gracious silence hail
wouldst thou have laughd had i come coffind home
that weepst to see me triumph ay my dear
such eyes the widows in corioli wear
and mothers that lack sons
now the gods crown thee
and live you yet
o my sweet lady pardon
a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep
and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome
a curse begin at very root ons heart
that is not glad to see thee you are three
we have some old crabtrees here
at home that will not
we call a nettle but a nettle and
the faults of fools but folly
ever right
menenius ever ever
give way there and go on
i have lived
to see inherited my very wishes
theres one thing wanting which i doubt not but
our rome will cast upon thee
know good mother
i had rather be their servant in my way
than sway with them in theirs
on to the capitol
all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
into a rapture lets her baby cry
her richest lockram bout her reechy neck
are smotherd up leads filld and ridges horsed
with variable complexions all agreeing
do press among the popular throngs and puff
commit the war of white and damask in
their nicelygawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
as if that whatsoever god who leads him
were slily crept into his human powers
and gave him graceful posture
on the sudden
i warrant him consul
then our office may
during his power go sleep
he cannot temperately transport his honours
from where he should begin and end but will
lose those he hath won
in that theres comfort
doubt not
the commoners for whom we stand but they
upon their ancient malice will forget
with the least cause these his new honours which
that he will give them make i as little question
as he is proud to dot
i heard him swear
were he to stand for consul never would he
appear i the marketplace nor on him put
the napless vesture of humility
nor showing as the manner is his wounds
to the people beg their stinking breaths
tis right
than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
and the desire of the nobles
i wish no better
than have him hold that purpose and to put it
in execution
tis most like he will
it shall be to him then as our good wills
a sure destruction
so it must fall out
to him or our authorities for an end
we must suggest the people in what hatred
he still hath held them that tos power he would
have made them mules silenced their pleaders and
dispropertied their freedoms holding them
in human action and capacity
of no more soul nor fitness for the world
than camels in the war who have their provand
only for bearing burdens and sore blows
for sinking under them
this as you say suggested
at some time when his soaring insolence
shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want
if he be put upon t and thats as easy
as to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire
to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
shall darken him for ever
whats the matter
you are sent for to the capitol tis thought
i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
as to joves statue and the commons made
i never saw the like
lets to the capitol
and carry with us ears and eyes for the time
but hearts for the event
have with you
come come they are almost here how many stand
for consulships
coriolanus will carry it
thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and
loves not the common people
faith there had been many great men that have
flattered the people who neer loved them and there
be many that they have loved they know not
coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly seet
if he did not care whether he had their love or no
he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither
devotion than can render it him and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite now to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes to flatter them for their love
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who
having been supple and courteous to the people
bonneted without any further deed to have them at
planted his honours in their eyes and his actions
in their hearts that for their tongues to be
silent and not confess so much were a kind of
ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a
malice that giving itself the lie would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it
are coming
having determined of the volsces and
to send for titus lartius it remains
as the main point of this our aftermeeting
to gratify his noble service that
please you
most reverend and grave elders to desire
the present consul and last general
in our wellfound successes to report
a little of that worthy work performd
by caius marcius coriolanus whom
we met here both to thank and to remember
with honours like himself
leave nothing out for length and make us think
rather our states defective for requital
than we to stretch it out
masters o the people
we do request your kindest ears and after
your loving motion toward the common body
to yield what passes here
we are convented
upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
inclinable to honour and advance
the theme of our assembly
which the rather
we shall be blest to do if he remember
a kinder value of the people than
he hath hereto prized them at
thats off thats off
i would you rather had been silent please you
to hear cominius speak
most willingly
but yet my caution was more pertinent
than the rebuke you give it
he loves your people
but tie him not to be their bedfellow
worthy cominius speak
nay keep your place
sit coriolanus never shame to hear
what you have nobly done
i had rather have my wounds to heal again
than hear say how i got them
sir i hope
my words disbenchd you not
when blows have made me stay i fled from words
your people
i love them as they weigh
pray now sit down
i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun
when the alarum were struck than idly sit
to hear my nothings monsterd
masters of the people
your multiplying spawn how can he flatter
thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see
he had rather venture all his limbs for honour
than one ons ears to hear it proceed cominius
should not be utterd feebly it is held
that valour is the chiefest virtue and
the man i speak of cannot in the world
be singly counterpoised at sixteen years
when tarquin made a head for rome he fought
whom with all praise i point at saw him fight
when with his amazonian chin he drove
an oerpressd roman and i the consuls view
when he might act the woman in the scene
he proved best man i the field and for his meed
was browbound with the oak his pupil age
manenterd thus he waxed like a sea
and in the brunt of seventeen battles since
he lurchd all swords of the garland for this last
before and in corioli let me say
and by his rare example made the coward
a vessel under sail so men obeyd
where it did mark it took from face to foot
he was a thing of blood whose every motion
the mortal gate of the city which he painted
with shunless destiny aidless came off
and with a sudden reinforcement struck
when by and by the din of war gan pierce
his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
requickend what in flesh was fatigate
and to the battle came he where he did
run reeking oer the lives of men as if
both field and city ours he never stood
to ease his breast with panting
worthy man
he cannot but with measure fit the honours
which we devise him
our spoils he kickd at
and lookd upon things precious as they were
than misery itself would give rewards
his deeds with doing them and is content
to spend the time to end it
let him be calld for
call coriolanus
he doth appear
the senate coriolanus are well pleased
to make thee consul
i do owe them still
my life and services
it then remains
that you do speak to the people
i do beseech you
let me oerleap that custom for i cannot
put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
that i may pass this doing
sir the people
must have their voices neither will they bate
one jot of ceremony
pray you go fit you to the custom and
take to you as your predecessors have
your honour with your form
it is apart
that i shall blush in acting and might well
be taken from the people
mark you that
to brag unto them thus i did and thus
show them the unaching scars which i should hide
as if i had received them for the hire
of their breath only
do not stand upont
we recommend to you tribunes of the people
wish we all joy and honour
to coriolanus come all joy and honour
you see how he intends to use the people
may they perceives intent he will require them
as if he did contemn what he requested
should be in them to give
come well inform them
i know they do attend us
once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him
we may sir if we will
we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
power that we have no power to do for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if
he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is
monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful
which we being members should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members
and to make us no better thought of a little help
will serve for once we stood up about the corn he
himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude
we have been called so of many not that our heads
are some brown some black some auburn some bald
truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull they would fly east west north south
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o the compass
think you so which way do you judge my wit would
fly
nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans
willtis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but
if it were at liberty twould sure southward
why that way
to lose itself in a fog where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return
for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife
are you all resolved to give your voices but
thats no matter the greater part carries it i
say if he would incline to the people there was
never a worthier man
behavior we are not to stay all together but to
come by him where he stands by ones by twos and
by threes hes to make his requests by
particulars wherein every one of us has a single
honour in giving him our own voices with our own
you shall go by him
content content
the worthiest men have donet
what must i say
i pray sirplague upont i cannot bring
i got them in my countrys service when
some certain of your brethren roard and ran
from the noise of our own drums
o me the gods
to think upon you
think upon me hang em
i would they would forget me like the virtues
which our divines lose by em
in wholesome manner
bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean
so here comes a brace
you know the cause air of my standing here
we do sir tell us what hath brought you tot
mine own desert
your own desert
ay but not mine own desire
how not your own desire
no sirtwas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging
you must think if we give you any thing we hope to
gain by you
well then i pray your price o the consulship
the price is to ask it kindly
show you which shall be yours in private your
good voice sir what say you
you shall ha it worthy sir
a match sir theres in all two worthy voices
but this is something odd
an twere to give againbut tis no matter
pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that i may be consul i have here the
customary gown
you have deserved nobly of your country and you
have not deserved nobly
your enigma
you have been a scourge to her enemies you have
been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved
the common people
you should account me the more virtuous that i have
not been common in my love i will sir flatter my
sworn brother the people to earn a dearer
estimation of them tis a condition they account
rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you
i may be consul
we hope to find you our friend and therefore give
you our voices heartily
you have received many wounds for your country
i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i
will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further
the gods give you joy sir heartily
most sweet voices
better it is to die better to starve
than crave the hire which first we do deserve
why in this woolvish toge should i stand here
to beg of hob and dick that do appear
what custom wills in all things should we dot
the dust on antique time would lie unswept
and mountainous error be too highly heapt
for truth to oerpeer rather than fool it so
let the high office and the honour go
to one that would do thus i am half through
the one part sufferd the other will i do
here come more voices
watchd for your voices for your voices bear
of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
i have seen and heard of for your voices have
indeed i would be consul
he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest
mans voice
and make him good friend to the people
amen amen god save thee noble consul
worthy voices
you have stood your limitation and the tribunes
that in the official marks invested you
anon do meet the senate
is this done
the people do admit you and are summond
to meet anon upon your approbation
where at the senatehouse
there coriolanus
may i change these garments
you may sir
that ill straight do and knowing myself again
repair to the senatehouse
ill keep you company will you along
we stay here for the people
fare you well
he has it now and by his looks methink
tis warm at s heart
with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds
will you dismiss the people
how now my masters have you chose this man
he has our voices sir
we pray the gods he may deserve your loves
he mockd us when he beggd our voices
certainly
he flouted us downright
not one amongst us save yourself but says
his marks of merit wounds received fors country
why so he did i am sure
no no no man saw em
he said he had wounds which he could show
in private
and with his hat thus waving it in scorn
but by your voices will not so permit me
your voices therefore when we granted that
your voices
i have no further with you was not this mockery
why either were you ignorant to seet
or seeing it of such childish friendliness
to yield your voices
could you not have told him
as you were lessond when he had no power
but was a petty servant to the state
he was your enemy ever spake against
your liberties and the charters that you bear
i the body of the weal and now arriving
a place of potency and sway o the state
if he should still malignantly remain
fast foe to the plebeii your voices might
be curses to yourselves you should have said
that as his worthy deeds did claim no less
than what he stood for so his gracious nature
would think upon you for your voices and
translate his malice towards you into love
standing your friendly lord
thus to have said
as you were foreadvised had touchd his spirit
and tried his inclination from him pluckd
either his gracious promise which you might
as cause had calld you up have held him to
or else it would have galld his surly nature
which easily endures not article
tying him to aught so putting him to rage
you should have taen the advantage of his choler
and passd him unelected
did you perceive
he did solicit you in free contempt
when he did need your loves and do you think
that his contempt shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush why had your bodies
no heart among you or had you tongues to cry
against the rectorship of judgment
have you
ere now denied the asker and now again
of him that did not ask but mock bestow
your suedfor tongues
hes not confirmd we may deny him yet
ill have five hundred voices of that sound
i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em
get you hence instantly and tell those friends
they have chose a consul that will from them take
their liberties make them of no more voice
than dogs that are as often beat for barking
as therefore kept to do so
let them assemble
and on a safer judgment all revoke
your ignorant election enforce his pride
and his old hate unto you besides forget not
with what contempt he wore the humble weed
how in his suit he scornd you but your loves
thinking upon his services took from you
the apprehension of his present portance
which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
after the inveterate hate he bears you
lay
a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured
no impediment between but that you must
cast your election on him
say you chose him
more after our commandment than as guided
by your own true affections and that your minds
preoccupied with what you rather must do
than what you should made you against the grain
ay spare us not say we read lectures to you
how youngly he began to serve his country
how long continued and what stock he springs of
the noble house o the marcians from whence came
that ancus marcius numas daughters son
who after great hostilius here was king
of the same house publius and quintus were
that our beat water brought by conduits hither
and
twice being
was his great ancestor
one thus descended
that hath beside well in his person wrought
to be set high in place we did commend
scaling his present bearing with his past
that hes your fixed enemy and revoke
your sudden approbation
say you neer had donet
harp on that stillbut by our putting on
and presently when you have drawn your number
repair to the capitol
repent in their election
let them go on
this mutiny were better put in hazard
if as his nature is he fall in rage
with their refusal both observe and answer
the vantage of his anger
we will be there before the stream o the people
and this shall seem as partly tis their own
which we have goaded onward
tullus aufidius then had made new head
he had my lord and that it was which caused
our swifter composition
so then the volsces stand but as at first
ready when time shall prompt them to make road
upons again
they are worn lord consul so
that we shall hardly in our ages see
their banners wave again
saw you aufidius
on safeguard he came to me and did curse
against the volsces for they had so vilely
spoke he of me
he did my lord
how what
how often he had met you sword to sword
that of all things upon the earth he hated
your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
to hopeless restitution so he might
be calld your vanquisher
at antium lives he
at antium
i wish i had a cause to seek him there
to oppose his hatred fully welcome home
behold these are the tribunes of the people
for they do prank them in authority
against all noble sufferance
pass no further
ha what is that
what makes this change
the matter
hath he not passd the noble and the common
cominius no
have i had childrens voices
tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace
the people are incensed against him
stop
or all will fall in broil
are these your herd
must these have voices that can yield them now
and straight disclaim their tongues what are
your offices
you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
have you not set them on
be calm be calm
it is a purposed thing and grows by plot
suffert and live with such as cannot rule
nor ever will be ruled
the people cry you mockd them and of late
when corn was given them gratis you repined
scandald the suppliants for the people calld them
timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
why this was known before
not to them all
have you informd them sithence
how i inform them
you are like to do such business
not unlike
each way to better yours
why then should i be consul by yond clouds
let me deserve so ill as you and make me
your fellow tribune
you show too much of that
to where you are bound you must inquire your way
which you are out of with a gentler spirit
or never be so noble as a consul
nor yoke with him for tribune
lets be calm
the people are abused set on this paltering
becomes not rome nor has coriolanus
deserved this so dishonourd rub laid falsely
i the plain way of his merit
tell me of corn
this was my speech and i will speakt again
not now not now
not in this heat sir now
now as i live i will my nobler friends
for the mutable rankscented many let them
regard me as i do not flatter and
in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate
the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
which we ourselves have ploughd for sowd
and scatterd
by mingling them with us the honourd number
who lack not virtue no nor power but that
which they have given to beggars
well no more
no more words we beseech you
how no more
as for my country i have shed my blood
not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
coin words till their decay against those measles
which we disdain should tatter us yet sought
the very way to catch them
you speak o the people
as if you were a god to punish not
a man of their infirmity
twere well
we let the people knowt
what what his choler
choler
were i as patient as the midnight sleep
by jove twould be my mind
it is a mind
that shall remain a poison where it is
not poison any further
shall remain
hear you this triton of the minnows mark you
his absolute shall
twas from the canon
shall
o good but most unwise patricians why
you grave but reckless senators have you thus
given hydra here to choose an officer
that with his peremptory shall being but
the horn and noise o the monsters wants not spirit
to say hell turn your current in a ditch
and make your channel his if he have power
then vail your ignorance if none awake
your dangerous lenity if you are learnd
be not as common fools if you are not
let them have cushions by you you are plebeians
when both your voices blended the greatst taste
most palates theirs they choose their magistrate
and such a one as he who puts his shall
his popular shall against a graver bench
than ever frown in greece by jove himself
to know when two authorities are up
neither supreme how soon confusion
may enter twixt the gap of both and take
the one by the other
well on to the marketplace
whoever gave that counsel to give forth
the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used
sometime in greece
well well no more of that
though there the people had more absolute power
i say they nourishd disobedience fed
the ruin of the state
why shall the people give
one that speaks thus their voice
ill give my reasons
more worthier than their voices they know the corn
was not our recompense resting well assured
even when the navel of the state was touchd
they would not thread the gates this kind of service
did not deserve corn gratis being i the war
their mutinies and revolts wherein they showd
which they have often made against the senate
all cause unborn could never be the motive
of our so frank donation well what then
how shall this bisson multitude digest
the senates courtesy let deeds express
we are the greater poll and in true fear
they gave us our demands thus we debase
the nature of our seats and make the rabble
call our cares fears which will in time
break ope the locks o the senate and bring in
the crows to peck the eagles
come enough
enough with overmeasure
what may be sworn by both divine and human
seal what i end withal this double worship
where one part does disdain with cause the other
insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
cannot conclude but by the yea and no
of general ignoranceit must omit
real necessities and give way the while
it follows
nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you
you that will be less fearful than discreet
that love the fundamental part of state
more than you doubt the change ont that prefer
a noble life before a long and wish
to jump a body with a dangerous physic
thats sure of death without it at once pluck out
the multitudinous tongue let them not lick
mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
of that integrity which should becomet
not having the power to do the good it would
for the in which doth controlt
has said enough
has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
as traitors do
thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee
what should the people do with these bald tribunes
on whom depending their obedience fails
when whats not meet but what must be was law
let what is meet be said it must be meet
and throw their power i the dust
manifest treason
this a consul no
the aediles ho
let him be apprehended
in whose name myself
attach thee as a traitorous innovator
and follow to thine answer
hence old goat
well surety him
aged sir hands off
hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones
out of thy garments
help ye citizens
on both sides more respect
heres he that would take from you all your power
seize him aediles
down with him down with him
weapons weapons weapons
tribunes patricians citizens what ho
sicinius brutus coriolanus citizens
peace peace peace stay hold peace
what is about to be i am out of breath
confusions near i cannot speak you tribunes
to the people coriolanus patience
speak good sicinius
hear me people peace
marcius would have all from you marcius
whom late you have named for consul
fie fie fie
this is the way to kindle not to quench
to unbuild the city and to lay all flat
what is the city but the people
true
the people are the city
by the consent of all we were establishd
the peoples magistrates
you so remain
and so are like to do
that is the way to lay the city flat
to bring the roof to the foundation
and bury all which yet distinctly ranges
in heaps and piles of ruin
this deserves death
or let us stand to our authority
or let us lose it we do here pronounce
upon the part o the people in whose power
we were elected theirs marcius is worthy
of present death
therefore lay hold of him
bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence
into destruction cast him
aediles seize him
yield marcius yield
hear me one word
beseech you tribunes hear me but a word
peace peace
sir those cold ways
that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
where the disease is violent lay hands upon him
and bear him to the rock
no ill die here
come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile
lay hands upon him
help marcius help
you that be noble help him young and old
down with him down with him
go get you to your house be gone away
all will be naught else
get you gone
stand fast
we have as many friends as enemies
sham it be put to that
the gods forbid
i prithee noble friend home to thy house
leave us to cure this cause
for tis a sore upon us
come sir along with us
i would they were barbariansas they are
though in rome litterdnot romansas they are not
though calved i the porch o the capitol
be gone
put not your worthy rage into your tongue
one time will owe another
on fair ground
i could beat forty of them
i could myself
take up a brace o the best of them yea the
but now tis odds beyond arithmetic
and manhood is calld foolery when it stands
against a falling fabric will you hence
before the tag return whose rage doth rend
like interrupted waters and oerbear
what they are used to bear
ill try whether my old wit be in request
with cloth of any colour
nay come away
this man has marrd his fortune
he would not flatter neptune for his trident
what his breast forges that his tongue must vent
and being angry does forget that ever
he heard the name of death
heres goodly work
i would they were abed
i would they were in tiber what the vengeance
could he not speak em fair
where is this viper
that would depopulate the city and
be every man himself
you worthy tribunes
he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock
and therefore law shall scorn him further trial
than the severity of the public power
which he so sets at nought
he shall well know
the noble tribunes are the peoples mouths
and we their hands
he shall sure ont
sir sir
peace
do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
with modest warrant
sir how comest that you
have holp to make this rescue
as i do know the consuls worthiness
so can i name his faults
consul what consul
the consul coriolanus
he consul
no no no no no
if by the tribunes leave and yours good people
i may be heard i would crave a word or two
the which shall turn you to no further harm
than so much loss of time
speak briefly then
for we are peremptory to dispatch
were but one danger and to keep him here
he dies tonight
now the good gods forbid
that our renowned rome whose gratitude
towards her deserved children is enrolld
in joves own book like an unnatural dam
should now eat up her own
hes a disease that must be cut away
o hes a limb that has but a disease
mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
what has he done to rome thats worthy death
killing our enemies the blood he hath lost
which i dare vouch is more than that he hath
by many an ouncehe droppd it for his country
and what is left to lose it by his country
were to us all that dot and suffer it
a brand to the end o the world
this is clean kam
it honourd him
the service of the foot
being once gangrened is not then respected
for what before it was
well hear no more
lest his infection being of catching nature
spread further
one word more one word
this tigerfooted rage when it shall find
the harm of unscannd swiftness will too late
tie leaden pounds tos heels proceed by process
lest parties as he is beloved break out
and sack great rome with romans
if it were so
what do ye talk
have we not had a taste of his obedience
our aediles smote ourselves resisted come
since he could draw a sword and is ill schoold
in bolted language meal and bran together
he throws without distinction give me leave
ill go to him and undertake to bring him
where he shall answer by a lawful form
in peace to his utmost peril
noble tribunes
will prove too bloody and the end of it
unknown to the beginning
noble menenius
be you then as the peoples officer
masters lay down your weapons
go not home
where if you bring not marcius well proceed
in our first way
ill bring him to you
or what is worst will follow
pray you lets to him
let them puff all about mine ears present me
death on the wheel or at wild horses heels
or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock
that the precipitation might down stretch
below the beam of sight yet will i still
be thus to them
you do the nobler
i muse my mother
does not approve me further who was wont
to call them woollen vassals things created
to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
in congregations to yawn be still and wonder
when one but of my ordinance stood up
to speak of peace or war
why did you wish me milder would you have me
false to my nature rather say i play
the man i am
o sir sir sir
i would have had you put your power well on
before you had worn it out
let go
you might have been enough the man you are
with striving less to be so lesser had been
the thwartings of your dispositions if
you had not showd them how ye were disposed
ere they lackd power to cross you
let them hang
ay and burn too
come come you have been too rough something
too rough
you must return and mend it
theres no remedy
unless by not so doing our good city
cleave in the midst and perish
i have a heart as little apt as yours
but yet a brain that leads my use of anger
to better vantage
well said noble woman
before he should thus stoop to the herd but that
the violent fit o the time craves it as physic
for the whole state i would put mine armour on
which i can scarcely bear
what must i do
return to the tribunes
well what then what then
repent what you have spoke
for them i cannot do it to the gods
must i then dot to them
you are too absolute
though therein you can never be too noble
but when extremities speak i have heard you say
honour and policy like unseverd friends
in peace what each of them by the other lose
that they combine not there
tush tush
a good demand
if it be honour in your wars to seem
the same you are not which for your best ends
you adopt your policy how is it less or worse
that it shall hold companionship in peace
with honour as in war since that to both
it stands in like request
why force you this
because that now it lies you on to speak
to the people not by your own instruction
nor by the matter which your heart prompts you
but with such words that are but rooted in
your tongue though but bastards and syllables
of no allowance to your bosoms truth
now this no more dishonours you at all
than to take in a town with gentle words
which else would put you to your fortune and
the hazard of much blood
i would dissemble with my nature where
my fortunes and my friends at stake required
your wife your son these senators the nobles
and you will rather show our general louts
how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em
for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
of what that want might ruin
noble lady
not what is dangerous present but the loss
of what is past
i prithee now my son
go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
and thus far having stretchd ithere be with them
thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business
action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant
more learned than the earswaving thy head
which often thus correcting thy stout heart
now humble as the ripest mulberry
thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
were fit for thee to use as they to claim
in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
as thou hast power and person
this but done
even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
for they have pardons being askd as free
as words to little purpose
prithee now
follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
than flatter him in a bower here is cominius
i have been i the marketplace and sirtis fit
you make strong party or defend yourself
only fair speech
i think twill serve if he
can thereto frame his spirit
he must and will
prithee now say you will and go about it
must i go show them my unbarbed sconce
must i with base tongue give my noble heart
yet were there but this single plot to lose
this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it
and throwt against the wind to the marketplace
you have put me now to such a part which never
i shall discharge to the life
come come well prompt you
i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
my praises made thee first a soldier so
to have my praise for this perform a part
thou hast not done before
away my disposition and possess me
some harlots spirit my throat of war be turnd
which quired with my drum into a pipe
small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves
tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up
the glasses of my sight a beggars tongue
make motion through my lips and my armd knees
who bowd but in my stirrup bend like his
that hath received an alms i will not dot
lest i surcease to honour mine own truth
and by my bodys action teach my mind
a most inherent baseness
to beg of thee it is my more dishonour
than thou of them come all to ruin let
thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death
with as big heart as thou do as thou list
thy valiantness was mine thou suckdst it from me
but owe thy pride thyself
mother i am going to the marketplace
chide me no more ill mountebank their loves
cog their hearts from them and come home beloved
commend me to my wife ill return consul
or never trust to what my tongue can do
i the way of flattery further
do your will
to answer mildly for they are prepared
with accusations as i hear more strong
than are upon you yet
let them accuse me by invention i
will answer in mine honour
ay but mildly
well mildly be it then mildly
in this point charge him home that he affects
enforce him with his envy to the people
and that the spoil got on the antiates
was neer distributed
what will he come
hes coming
how accompanied
with old menenius and those senators
that always favourd him
have you a catalogue
of all the voices that we have procured
set down by the poll
i have tis ready
have you collected them by tribes
i have
assemble presently the people hither
and when they bear me say it shall be so
i the right and strength o the commons be it either
for death for fine or banishment then let them
if i say fine cry fine if death cry death
insisting on the old prerogative
and power i the truth o the cause
i shall inform them
and when such time they have begun to cry
let them not cease but with a din confused
enforce the present execution
of what we chance to sentence
very well
make them be strong and ready for this hint
when we shall hap to give t them
go about it
ever to conquer and to have his worth
be reind again to temperance then he speaks
whats in his heart and that is there which looks
with us to break his neck
well here he comes
calmly i do beseech you
ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece
will bear the knave by the volume the honourd gods
keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice
supplied with worthy men plant love among s
throng our large temples with the shows of peace
and not our streets with war
amen amen
a noble wish
draw near ye people
first hear me speak
well say peace ho
shall i be charged no further than this present
must all determine here
i do demand
if you submit you to the peoples voices
allow their officers and are content
to suffer lawful censure for such faults
as shall be proved upon you
i am content
the warlike service he has done consider think
upon the wounds his body bears which show
like graves i the holy churchyard
scratches with briers
scars to move laughter only
consider further
that when he speaks not like a citizen
his rougher accents for malicious sounds
but as i say such as become a soldier
rather than envy you
well well no more
what is the matter
that being passd for consul with full voice
i am so dishonourd that the very hour
you take it off again
answer to us
we charge you that you have contrived to take
from rome all seasond office and to wind
yourself into a power tyrannical
for which you are a traitor to the people
how traitor
nay temperately your promise
the fires i the lowest hell foldin the people
call me their traitor thou injurious tribune
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
in thy hand clutchd as many millions in
thy lying tongue both numbers i would say
thou liest unto thee with a voice as free
as i do pray the gods
mark you this people
to the rock to the rock with him
peace
what you have seen him do and heard him speak
beating your officers cursing yourselves
opposing laws with strokes and here defying
those whose great power must try him even this
so criminal and in such capital kind
deserves the extremest death
but since he hath
served well for rome
what do you prate of service
i talk of that that know it
you
is this the promise that you made your mother
know i pray you
let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death
vagabond exile raying pent to linger
but with a grain a day i would not buy
their mercy at the price of one fair word
nor cheque my courage for what they can give
to havet with saying good morrow
for that he has
as much as in him lies from time to time
envied against the people seeking means
to pluck away their power as now at last
given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
of dreaded justice but on the ministers
that do distribute it in the name o the people
and in the power of us the tribunes we
even from this instant banish him our city
in peril of precipitation
from off the rock tarpeian never more
i say it shall be so
hes banishd and it shall be so
hear me my masters and my common friends
hes sentenced no more hearing
i have been consul and can show for rome
her enemies marks upon me i do love
my countrys good with a respect more tender
more holy and profound than mine own life
my dear wifes estimate her wombs increase
and treasure of my loins then if i would
speak that
theres no more to be said but he is banishd
it shall be so
it shall be so it shall be so
you common cry of curs whose breath i hate
as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize
as the dead carcasses of unburied men
that do corrupt my air i banish you
and here remain with your uncertainty
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
your enemies with nodding of their plumes
fan you into despair have the power still
to banish your defenders till at length
your ignorance which finds not till it feels
making not reservation of yourselves
still your own foes deliver you as most
abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows despising
there is a world elsewhere
the peoples enemy is gone is gone
our enemy is banishd he is gone hoo hoo
go see him out at gates and follow him
as he hath followed you with all despite
give him deserved vexation let a guard
attend us through the city
come come lets see him out at gates come
the gods preserve our noble tribunes come
with many heads butts me away nay mother
where is your ancient courage you were used
to say extremity was the trier of spirits
that common chances common men could bear
that when the sea was calm all boats alike
showd mastership in floating fortunes blows
when most struck home being gentle wounded craves
with precepts that would make invincible
the heart that connd them
o heavens o heavens
nay prithee woman
now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome
and occupations perish
what what what
i shall be loved when i am lackd nay mother
resume that spirit when you were wont to say
if you had been the wife of hercules
six of his labours yould have done and saved
your husband so much sweat cominius
ill do well yet thou old and true menenius
thy tears are salter than a younger mans
and venomous to thine eyes my sometime general
i have seen thee stem and thou hast oft beheld
hearthardening spectacles tell these sad women
tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
as tis to laugh at em my mother you wot well
believet not lightlythough i go alone
like to a lonely dragon that his fen
makes feard and talkd of more than seenyour son
will or exceed the common or be caught
with cautelous baits and practise
my first son
whither wilt thou go take good cominius
more than a wild exposture to each chance
that starts i the way before thee
o the gods
ill follow thee a month devise with thee
where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
a cause for thy repeal we shall not send
oer the vast world to seek a single man
and lose advantage which doth ever cool
i the absence of the needer
thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full
of the wars surfeits to go rove with one
come my sweet wife my dearest mother and
my friends of noble touch when i am forth
bid me farewell and smile i pray you come
while i remain above the ground you shall
hear from me still and never of me aught
but what is like me formerly

if i could shake off but one seven years
from these old arms and legs by the good gods
ild with thee every foot
bid them all home hes gone and well no further
the nobility are vexd whom we see have sided
in his behalf
now we have shown our power

people against the senators patricians and nobles

breaking out

how sir do you meddle with my master
ay tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress thou pratest and pratest serve with thy
trencher hence
where is this fellow
disturbing the lords within
whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name
if tullus
not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not
think me for the man i am necessity
commands me name myself
what is thy name
a name unmusical to the volscians ears
and harsh in sound to thine
say whats thy name
thou hast a grim appearance and thy face
bears a command int though thy tackles torn
thou me yet
my name is caius marcius who hath done
to thee particularly and to all the volsces
great hurt and mischief thereto witness may
the extreme dangers and the drops of blood
shed for my thankless country are requited
but with that surname a good memory
and witness of the malice and displeasure
the cruelty and envy of the people
permitted by our dastard nobles who
have all forsook me hath devourd the rest
and sufferd me by the voice of slaves to be
whoopd out of rome now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope
mistake me notto save my life for if
i had feard death of all the men i the world
i would have voided thee but in mere spite
to be full quit of those my banishers
stand i before thee here then if thou hast
a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge
thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
of shame seen through thy country speed
thee straight
that my revengeful services may prove
as benefits to thee for i will fight
against my cankerd country with the spleen
of all the under fiends but if so be
thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
thourt tired then in a word i also am
longer to live most weary and present
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
which not to cut would show thee but a fool
since i have ever followd thee with hate
drawn tuns of blood out of thy countrys breast
and cannot live but to thy shame unless
it be to do thee service
o marcius marcius
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy if jupiter
should from yond cloud speak divine things
and say tis true ild not believe them more
than thee all noble marcius let me twine
mine arms about that body where against
my grained ash an hundred times hath broke
the anvil of my sword and do contest
as hotly and as nobly with thy love
as ever in ambitious strength i did
contend against thy valour know thou first
i loved the maid i married never man
sighd truer breath but that i see thee here
thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
than when i first my wedded mistress saw
bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee
we have a power on foot and i had purpose
once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
twelve several times and i have nightly since
dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me
we have been down together in my sleep
unbuckling helms fisting each others throat
and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius
had we no quarrel else to rome but that
thou art thence banishd we would muster all
from twelve to seventy and pouring war
into the bowels of ungrateful rome
like a bold flood oerbear o come go in
and take our friendly senators by the hands
who now are here taking their leaves of me
who am prepared against your territories
though not for rome itself
you bless me gods
therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
the leading of thine own revenges take
the one half of my commission and set down
as best thou art experienced since thou knowst
thy countrys strength and weaknessthine own ways
whether to knock against the gates of rome
or rudely visit them in parts remote
let me commend thee first to those that shall
say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes
and more a friend than eer an enemy
heres a strange alteration
by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him
what an arm he has he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
nay i knew by his face that there was something in
cannot tell how to term it
he had so looking as it werewould i were hanged
but i thought there was more in him than i could think
man i the world
who my master
nay its no matter for that
worth six on him
greater soldier
for the defence of a town our general is excellent
ay and for an assault too
o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals
what what what lets partake
i would not be a roman of all nations i had as
lieve be a condemned man
wherefore wherefore
why heres he that was wont to thwack our general
caius marcius
why do you say thwack our general 
i do not say thwack our general but he was always
good enough for him
hard for him i have heard him say so himself
he was too hard for him directly to say the troth
him like a carbon ado
an he had been cannibally given he might have
broiled and eaten him too
but more of thy news
why he is so made on here within as if he were son
and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no
question asked him by any of the senators but they
turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table hell go he says
will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled
and hes as like to dot as any man i can imagine
dot he will dot for look you sir he has as
many friends as enemies which friends sir as it
were durst not look you sir show themselves as
we term it his friends whilst hes in directitude
directitude whats that
but when they shall see sir his crest up again
and the man in blood they will out of their
burrows like conies after rain and revel all with
him
but when goes this forward
tomorrow today presently you shall have the
parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips
why then we shall have a stirring world again
this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase
tailors and breed balladmakers
let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as
day does night its spritely waking audible and
full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy
mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more
bastard children than wars a destroyer of men
be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds
ay and it makes men hate one another
reason because they then less need one another
the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap
as volscians they are rising they are rising
in in in in
we hear not of him neither need we fear him
his remedies are tame i the present peace
and quietness of the people which before
were in wild hurry here do we make his friends
blush that the world goes well who rather had
though they themselves did suffer byt behold
dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
our tradesmen with in their shops and going
about their functions friendly
we stood tot in good time
is this menenius
hail sir
hail to you both
your coriolanus
the commonwealth doth stand and so would do
were he more angry at it
alls well and might have been much better if
he could have temporized
where is he hear you
hear nothing from him
the gods preserve you both
godden our neighbours
godden to you all godden to you all
ourselves our wives and children on our knees
are bound to pray for you both
live and thrive
had loved you as we did
now the gods keep you
farewell farewell
this is a happier and more comely time
than when these fellows ran about the streets
crying confusion
caius marcius was
a worthy officer i the war but insolent
oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
selfloving
and affecting one sole throne
without assistance
i think not so
we should by this to all our lamentation
if he had gone forth consul found it so
the gods have well prevented it and rome
sits safe and still without him
worthy tribunes
there is a slave whom we have put in prison
reports the volsces with two several powers
are enterd in the roman territories
and with the deepest malice of the war
destroy what lies before em
tis aufidius
who hearing of our marcius banishment
thrusts forth his horns again into the world
which were inshelld when marcius stood for rome
and durst not once peep out
come what talk you
of marcius
go see this rumourer whippd it cannot be
the volsces dare break with us
cannot be
we have record that very well it can
and three examples of the like have been
within my age but reason with the fellow
before you punish him where he heard this
lest you shall chance to whip your information
and beat the messenger who bids beware
of what is to be dreaded
i know this cannot be
not possible
the nobles in great earnestness are going
that turns their countenances
tis this slave
nothing but his report
yes worthy sir
the slaves report is seconded and more
more fearful is deliverd
what more fearful
it is spoke freely out of many mouths
how probable i do not knowthat marcius
joind with aufidius leads a power gainst rome
and vows revenge as spacious as between
the youngst and oldest thing
this is most likely
raised only that the weaker sort may wish
good marcius home again
the very trick ont
he and aufidius can no more atone
than violentest contrariety
a fearful army led by caius marcius
associated with aufidius rages
upon our territories and have already
oerborne their way consumed with fire and took
what lay before them
o you have made good work
what news what news
you have holp to ravish your own daughters and
to melt the city leads upon your pates
to see your wives dishonourd to your noses
whats the news whats the news
your temples burned in their cement and
your franchises whereon you stood confined
into an augers bore
pray now your news
you have made fair work i fear mepray your news
if marcius should be joind with volscians
if
made by some other deity than nature
that shapes man better and they follow him
against us brats with no less confidence
than boys pursuing summer butterflies
or butchers killing flies
you have made good work
you and your apronmen you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
the breath of garliceaters
he will shake
your rome about your ears
as hercules
did shake down mellow fruit
you have made fair work
but is this true sir
ay and youll look pale
before you find it other all the regions
do smilingly revolt and who resist
are mockd for valiant ignorance
and perish constant fools who ist can blame him
your enemies and his find something in him
we are all undone unless
the noble man have mercy
who shall ask it
the tribunes cannot dot for shame the people
deserve such pity of him as the wolf
should say be good to rome they charged him even
as those should do that had deserved his hate
and therein showd like enemies
if he were putting to my house the brand
that should consume it i have not the face
to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands
you and your crafts you have crafted fair
you have brought
a trembling upon rome such as was never
so incapable of help
say not we brought it
how was it we we loved him but like beasts
and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
who did hoot him out o the city
but i fear
theyll roar him in again tullus aufidius
the second name of men obeys his points
is all the policy strength and defence
that rome can make against them
here come the clusters
and is aufidius with him you are they
that made the air unwholesome when you cast
your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
coriolanus exile now hes coming
and not a hair upon a soldiers head
as you threw caps up will he tumble down
and pay you for your voices tis no matter
if he could burn us all into one coal
we have deserved it
faith we hear fearful news
for mine own part
when i said banish him i said twas pity
and so did i
and so did i and to say the truth so did very
though we willingly consented to his banishment yet
it was against our will
ye re goodly things you voices
you have made
good work you and your cry shalls to the capitol
o ay what else
these are a side that would be glad to have
this true which they so seem to fear go home
and show no sign of fear
the gods be good to us come masters lets home
i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished
him
so did we all but come lets home
i do not like this news
nor i
lets to the capitol would half my wealth
would buy this for a lie
pray let us go
do they still fly to the roman
i do not know what witchcrafts in him but
your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
their talk at table and their thanks at end
and you are darkend in this action sir
even by your own
i cannot help it now
unless by using means i lame the foot
of our design he bears himself more proudlier
even to my person than i thought he would
in thats no changeling and i must excuse
what cannot be amended
yet i wish sir
i mean for your particularyou had not
joind in commission with him but either
had borne the action of yourself or else
to him had left it solely
i understand thee well and be thou sure
when he shall come to his account he knows not
what i can urge against him although it seems
and so he thinks and is no less apparent
to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
and shows good husbandry for the volscian state
fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon
as draw his sword yet he hath left undone
that which shall break his neck or hazard mine
wheneer we come to our account
sir i beseech you think you hell carry rome
all places yield to him ere he sits down
the tribunes are no soldiers and their people
will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
to expel him thence i think hell be to rome
as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
by sovereignty of nature first he was
a noble servant to them but he could not
which out of daily fortune ever taints
the happy man whether defect of judgment
to fail in the disposing of those chances
which he was lord of or whether nature
not to be other than one thing not moving
from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace
even with the same austerity and garb
as he controlld the war but one of these
as he hath spices of them all not all
for i dare so far free himmade him feard
to choke it in the utterance so our virtues
and power unto itself most commendable
hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
to extol what it hath done
one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
come lets away when caius rome is thine
thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine
which was sometime his general who loved him
but what o that go you that banishd him
a mile before his tent fall down and knee
to hear cominius speak ill keep at home
he would not seem to know me
do you hear
i urged our old acquaintance and the drops
that we have bled together coriolanus
he was a kind of nothing titleless
till he had forged himself a name o the fire
of burning rome
a pair of tribunes that have rackd for rome
to make coals cheapa noble memory
i minded him how royal twas to pardon
it was a bare petition of a state
to one whom they had punishd
could he say less
i offerd to awaken his regard
he could not stay to pick them in a pile
for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
and still to nose the offence
for one poor grain or two
i am one of those his mother wife his child
you are the musty chaff and you are smelt
in this so neverneeded help yet do not
upbraids with our distress but sure if you
would be your countrys pleader your good tongue
more than the instant army we can make
might stop our countryman
no ill not meddle
pray you go to him
what should i do
only make trial what your love can do
for rome towards marcius
well and say that marcius
return me as cominius is returnd
unheard what then
but as a discontented friend griefshot
with his unkindness sayt be so
yet your good will
must have that thanks from rome after the measure
as you intended well
i think hell hear me yet to bite his lip
and hum at good cominius much unhearts me
the veins unfilld our blood is cold and then
we pout upon the morning are unapt
to give or to forgive but when we have stuffd
these and these conveyances of our blood
with wine and feeding we have suppler souls
till he be dieted to my request
and then ill set upon him
you know the very road into his kindness
and cannot lose your way
good faith ill prove him
speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge
of my success
hell never hear him
not
i tell you he does sit in gold his eye
red as twould burn rome and his injury
the gaoler to his pity i kneeld before him
twas very faintly he said rise dismissd me
he sent in writing after me what he would not
so that all hope is vain
unless his noble mother and his wife
who as i hear mean to solicit him
for mercy to his country therefore lets hence
and with our fair entreaties haste them on
stand and go back
i am an officer of state and come
to speak with coriolanus
from whence
from rome
will no more hear from thence
youll see your rome embraced with fire before
youll speak with coriolanus
good my friends
if you have heard your general talk of rome
and of his friends there it is lots to blanks
my name hath touchd your ears it is menenius
is not here passable
i tell thee fellow
the book of his good acts whence men have read
his name unparalleld haply amplified
for i have ever verified my friends
of whom hes chief with all the size that verity
like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
i must have leave to pass
faith sir if you had told as many lies in his
behalf as you have uttered words in your own you
should not pass here no though it were as virtuous
to lie as to live chastely therefore go back
prithee fellow remember my name is menenius
always factionary on the party of your general
howsoever you have been his liar as you say you
have i am one that telling true under him must
say you cannot pass therefore go back
has he dined canst thou tell for i would not
speak with him till after dinner
you are a roman are you
i am as thy general is
then you should hate rome as he does can you
when you have pushed out your gates the very
defender of them and in a violent popular
ignorance given your enemy your shield think to
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women the virginal palms of your daughters or with
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in with
such weak breath as this no you are deceived
therefore back to rome and prepare for your
you out of reprieve and pardon
sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would
use me with estimation
come my captain knows you not
i mean thy general
my general cares not for you back i say go lest
i let forth your halfpint of blood backthats
nay but fellow fellow
whats the matter
you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall
perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from
with him if thou standest not i the state of
hanging or of some death more long in
spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now
presently and swoon for whats to come upon thee
the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity and love thee no worse than
thy old father menenius does o my son my son
thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres
water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to
thee but being assured none but myself could move
thee i have been blown out of your gates with
sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy
petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy
wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
herethis who like a block hath denied my
access to thee
away
how away
wife mother child i know not my affairs
my revenge properly my remission lies
in volscian breasts that we have been familiar
ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
than pity note how much therefore be gone
mine ears against your suits are stronger than
your gates against my force yet for i loved thee
take this along i writ it for thy sake
and would have rent it another word menenius
i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius
you keep a constant temper
now sir is your name menenius
way home again
do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back
what cause do you think i have to swoon
such things as you i can scarce think theres any
yere so slight he that hath a will to die by
do his worst for you be that you are long and
your misery increase with your age i say to you
as i was said to away
a noble fellow i warrant him
oak not to be windshaken
we will before the walls of rome tomorrow
set down our host my partner in this action
you must report to the volscian lords how plainly
i have borne this business
only their ends
you have respected stoppd your ears against
the general suit of rome never admitted
a private whisper no not with such friends
that thought them sure of you
this last old man
whom with a crackd heart i have sent to rome
loved me above the measure of a father
nay godded me indeed their latest refuge
was to send him for whose old love i have
though i showd sourly to him once more offerd
the first conditions which they did refuse
and cannot now accept to grace him only
that thought he could do more a very little
nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
will i lend ear to ha what shout is this
shall i be tempted to infringe my vow
in the same time tis made i will not
my wife comes foremost then the honourd mould
wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand
the grandchild to her blood but out affection
all bond and privilege of nature break
let it be virtuous to be obstinate
what is that curtsy worth or those doves eyes
which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not
of stronger earth than others my mother bows
as if olympus to a molehill should
hath an aspect of intercession which
great nature cries deny not let the volsces
be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
as if a man were author of himself
and knew no other kin
my lord and husband
these eyes are not the same i wore in rome
the sorrow that delivers us thus changed
makes you think so
like a dull actor now
i have forgot my part and i am out
even to a full disgrace best of my flesh
forgive my tyranny but do not say
for that forgive our romans o a kiss
long as my exile sweet as my revenge
now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
i carried from thee dear and my true lip
hath virgind it eer since you gods i prate
and the most noble mother of the world
of thy deep duty more impression show
than that of common sons
o stand up blest
whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
i kneel before thee and unproperly
show duty as mistaken all this while
between the child and parent
what is this
your knees to me to your corrected son
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun
murdering impossibility to make
what cannot be slight work
thou art my warrior
i holp to frame thee do you know this lady
the noble sister of publicola
the moon of rome chaste as the icicle
thats curdied by the frost from purest snow
this is a poor epitome of yours
which by the interpretation of full time
may show like all yourself
the god of soldiers
with the consent of supreme jove inform
thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
to shame unvulnerable and stick i the wars
like a great seamark standing every flaw
and saving those that eye thee
your knee sirrah
thats my brave boy
even he your wife this lady and myself
are suitors to you
the thing i have forsworn to grant may never
be held by you denials do not bid me
dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
to ally my rages and revenges with
your colder reasons
o no more no more
you have said you will not grant us any thing
for we have nothing else to ask but that
that if you fail in our request the blame
aufidius and you volsces mark for well
hear nought from rome in private your request
should we be silent and not speak our raiment
and state of bodies would bewray what life
we have led since thy exile think with thyself
how more unfortunate than all living women
which should
make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance
with comforts
constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
making the mother wife and child to see
the son the husband and the father tearing
his countrys bowels out and to poor we
our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
that all but we enjoy for how can we
alas how can we for our country pray
whereto we are bound together with thy victory
whereto we are bound alack or we must lose
the country our dear nurse or else thy person
our comfort in the country we must find
an evident calamity though we had
must as a foreign recreant be led
with manacles thorough our streets or else
triumphantly tread on thy countrys ruin
and bear the palm for having bravely shed
thy wife and childrens blood for myself son
i purpose not to wait on fortune till
rather to show a noble grace to both parts
than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
march to assault thy country than to tread
trust tot thou shalt noton thy mothers womb
that brought thee to this world
ay and mine
that brought you forth this boy to keep your name
living to time
a shall not tread on me
ill run away till i am bigger but then ill fight
not of a womans tenderness to be
requires nor child nor womans face to see
i have sat too long
nay go not from us thus
if it were so that our request did tend
to save the romans thereby to destroy
the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
may say this mercy we have showd the romans
this we received and each in either side
give the allhail to thee and cry be blest
for making up this peace thou knowst great son
the end of wars uncertain but this certain
that if thou conquer rome the benefit
which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
whose repetition will be doggd with curses
but with his last attempt he wiped it out
destroyd his country and his name remains
thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
to imitate the graces of the gods
to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air
and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
that should but rive an oak why dost not speak
thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man
perhaps thy childishness will move him more
than can our reasons theres no man in the world
more bound to s mother yet here he lets me prate
like one i the stocks thou hast never in thy life
showd thy dear mother any courtesy
when she poor hen fond of no second brood
has cluckd thee to the wars and safely home
loaden with honour say my requests unjust
thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
that thou restrainst from me the duty which
down ladies let us shame him with our knees
to his surname coriolanus longs more pride
this boy that cannot tell what he would have
but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship
does reason our petition with more strength
this fellow had a volscian to his mother
his wife is in corioli and his child
i am hushd until our city be afire
and then ill speak a little
o mother mother
what have you done behold the heavens do ope
the gods look down and this unnatural scene
they laugh at o my mother mother o
you have won a happy victory to rome
but for your sonbelieve it o believe it
most dangerously you have with him prevaild
if not most mortal to him but let it come
aufidius though i cannot make true wars
ill frame convenient peace now good aufidius
were you in my stead would you have heard
a mother less or granted less aufidius
i was moved withal
and sir it is no little thing to make
mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir
ill not to rome ill back with you and pray you
stand to me in this cause o mother wife
ay by and by
but we will drink together and you shall bear
a better witness back than words which we
on like conditions will have counterseald
come enter with us ladies you deserve
in italy and her confederate arms
could not have made this peace
see you yond coign o the capitol yond
cornerstone
why what of that
if it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger there is some hope the ladies of
rome especially his mother may prevail with him
sentenced and stay upon execution
ist possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man
there is differency between a grub and a butterfly
yet your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown
creeping thing
he loved his mother dearly
now than an eightyearold horse the tartness
moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before
his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a
battery he sits in his state as a thing made for
alexander what he bids be done is finished with
his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in
yes mercy if you report him truly
i paint him in the character mark what mercy his
in him than there is milk in a male tiger that
you
the gods be good unto us
no in such a case the gods will not be good unto
us when we banished him we respected not them
and he returning to break our necks they respect not us
the plebeians have got your fellowtribune
and hale him up and down all swearing if
the roman ladies bring not comfort home
theyll give him death by inches
whats the news
good news good news the ladies have prevaild
a merrier day did never yet greet rome
no not the expulsion of the tarquins
friend
art thou certain this is true is it most certain
where have you lurkd that you make doubt of it
neer through an arch so hurried the blown tide
as the recomforted through the gates why hark you
the trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes
tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans
make the sun dance hark you
i will go meet the ladies this volumnia
is worth of consuls senators patricians
a city full of tribunes such as you
this morning for ten thousand of your throats
id not have given a doit hark how they joy
first the gods bless you for your tidings next
accept my thankfulness
sir we have all
great cause to give great thanks
they are near the city
almost at point to enter
we will meet them
and help the joy
behold our patroness the life of rome
call all your tribes together praise the gods
unshout the noise that banishd marcius
repeal him with the welcome of his mother
cry welcome ladies welcome
welcome ladies welcome
bid them repair to the market place where i
even in theirs and in the commons ears
will vouch the truth of it him i accuse
the city ports by this hath enterd and
intends to appear before the people hoping
most welcome
how is it with our general
even so
as with a man by his own alms empoisond
and with his charity slain
most noble sir
if you do hold the same intent wherein
you wishd us parties well deliver you
of your great danger
we must proceed as we do find the people
the people will remain uncertain whilst
twixt you theres difference but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all
i know it
and my pretext to strike at him admits
a good construction i raised him and i pawnd
he waterd his new plants with dews of flattery
seducing so my friends and to this end
he bowd his nature never known before
but to be rough unswayable and free
sir his stoutness
when he did stand for consul which he lost
by lack of stooping
being banishd fort he came unto my hearth
made him jointservant with me gave him way
in all his own desires nay let him choose
out of my files his projects to accomplish
my best and freshest men served his designments
in mine own person holp to reap the fame
which he did end all his and took some pride
i seemd his follower not partner and
he waged me with his countenance as if
i had been mercenary
the army marvelld at it and in the last
when he had carried rome and that we lookd
for no less spoil than glory
for which my sinews shall be stretchd upon him
at a few drops of womens rheum which are
as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
and ill renew me in his fall but hark
your native town you enterd like a post
splitting the air with noise
and patient fools
whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
with giving him glory
therefore at your vantage
ere he express himself or move the people
with what he would say let him feel your sword
which we will second when he lies along
after your way his tale pronounced shall bury
his reasons with his body
here come the lords
you are most welcome home
i have not deserved it
but worthy lords have you with heed perused
what i have written to you
we have
and grieve to heart
what faults he made before the last i think
where he was to begin and give away
the benefit of our levies answering us
with our own charge making a treaty where
there was a yieldingthis admits no excuse
hail lords i am returnd your soldier
no more infected with my countrys love
than when i parted hence but still subsisting
under your great command you are to know
that prosperously i have attempted and
with bloody passage led your wars even to
the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home
do more than counterpoise a full third part
the charges of the action we have made peace
with no less honour to the antiates
subscribed by the consuls and patricians
together with the seal o the senate what
we have compounded on
read it not noble lords
but tell the traitor in the highst degree
he hath abused your powers
traitor how now
ay traitor marcius
marcius
ill grace thee with that robbery thy stoln name
coriolanus in corioli
you lords and heads o the state perfidiously
he has betrayd your business and given up
for certain drops of salt your city rome
i say your city to his wife and mother
breaking his oath and resolution like
a twist of rotten silk never admitting
counsel o the war but at his nurses tears
he whined and roard away your victory
that pages blushd at him and men of heart
lookd wondering each at other
hearst thou mars
name not the god thou boy of tears
ha
no more
measureless liar thou hast made my heart
too great for what contains it boy o slave
pardon me lords tis the first time that ever
i was forced to scold your judgments my grave lords
who wears my stripes impressd upon him that
must bear my beating to his graveshall join
to thrust the lie unto him
peace both and hear me speak
cut me to pieces volsces men and lads
stain all your edges on me boy false hound
if you have writ your annals true tis there
that like an eagle in a dovecote i
alone i did it boy
why noble lords
will you be put in mind of his blind fortune
which was your shame by this unholy braggart
fore your own eyes and ears
let him die fort
tear him to pieces do it presently he killd
my son my daughter he killed my cousin
marcus he killed my father
the man is noble and his fame foldsin
this orb o the earth his last offences to us

o that i had him
with six aufidiuses or more his tribe
to use my lawful sword
insolent villain

provoked by him you cannotthe great danger
which this mans life did owe you youll rejoice
that he is thus cut off please it your honours
to call me to your senate ill deliver
myself your loyal servant or endure
your heaviest censure

as the most noble corse that ever herald
did follow to his urn
his own impatience
takes from aufidius a great part of blame
lets make the best of it
my rage is gone
and i am struck with sorrow take him up
help three o the chiefest soldiers ill be one
trail your steel pikes though in this city he
hath widowd and unchilded many a one
which to this hour bewail the injury
yet he shall have a noble memory assist
now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of york
and all the clouds that lourd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
our bruised arms hung up for monuments
our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
our dreadful marches to delightful measures
grimvisaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
and now instead of mounting barded steeds
to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks
nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
i that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty
to strut before a wanton ambling nymph
i that am curtaild of this fair proportion
cheated of feature by dissembling nature
deformed unfinishd sent before my time
into this breathing world scarce half made up
and that so lamely and unfashionable
that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
why i in this weak piping time of peace
have no delight to pass away the time
unless to spy my shadow in the sun
and therefore since i cannot prove a lover
to entertain these fair wellspoken days
i am determined to prove a villain
and hate the idle pleasures of these days
plots have i laid inductions dangerous
by drunken prophecies libels and dreams
to set my brother clarence and the king
and if king edward be as true and just
as i am subtle false and treacherous
this day should clarence closely be mewd up
about a prophecy which says that g
of edwards heirs the murderer shall be
clarence comes
brother good day what means this armed guard
that waits upon your grace
his majesty
tendering my persons safety hath appointed
this conduct to convey me to the tower
upon what cause
because my name is george
alack my lord that fault is none of yours
o belike his majesty hath some intent
that you shall be newchristend in the tower
but whats the matter clarence  may i know
yea richard when i know for i protest
he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
and from the crossrow plucks the letter g
and says a wizard told him that by g
his issue disinherited should be
and for my name of george begins with g
it follows in his thought that i am he
these as i learn and such like toys as these
have moved his highness to commit me now
my lady grey his wife clarence tis she
that tempers him to this extremity
was it not she and that good man of worship
anthony woodville her brother there
that made him send lord hastings to the tower
from whence this present day he is deliverd
we are not safe clarence we are not safe
by heaven i think theres no man is secure
but the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds
that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
heard ye not what an humble suppliant
lord hastings was to her for his delivery
humbly complaining to her deity
got my lord chamberlain his liberty
ill tell you what i think it is our way
if we will keep in favour with the king
the jealous oerworn widow and herself
since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen
are mighty gossips in this monarchy
i beseech your graces both to pardon me
his majesty hath straitly given in charge
that no man shall have private conference
of what degree soever with his brother
even so ant please your worship brakenbury
is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
well struck in years fair and not jealous
we say that shores wife hath a pretty foot
a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
how say you sir can you deny all this
with this my lord myself have nought to do
naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow
he that doth naught with her excepting one
were best he do it secretly alone
what one my lord
i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal
forbear your conference with the noble duke
we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey
we are the queens abjects and must obey
and whatsoever you will employ me in
were it to call king edwards widow sister
i will perform it to enfranchise you
meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
touches me deeper than you can imagine
i know it pleaseth neither of us well
well your imprisonment shall not be long
meantime have patience
i must perforce farewell
go tread the path that thou shalt neer return
simple plain clarence i do love thee so
that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven
if heaven will take the present at our hands
but who comes here the newdeliverd hastings
good time of day unto my gracious lord
as much unto my good lord chamberlain
well are you welcome to the open air
how hath your lordship brookd imprisonment
but i shall live my lord to give them thanks
that were the cause of my imprisonment
no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too
for they that were your enemies are his
and have prevaild as much on him as you
more pity that the eagle should be mewd
while kites and buzzards prey at liberty
what news abroad
no news so bad abroad as this at home
the king is sickly weak and melancholy
and his physicians fear him mightily
now by saint paul this news is bad indeed
o he hath kept an evil diet long
tis very grievous to be thought upon
what is he in his bed
he is
go you before and i will follow you
he cannot live i hope and must not die
till george be packd with posthorse up to heaven
ill in to urge his hatred more to clarence
with lies well steeld with weighty arguments
and if i fall not in my deep intent
which done god take king edward to his mercy
and leave the world for me to bustle in
for then ill marry warwicks youngest daughter
what though i killd her husband and her father
the readiest way to make the wench amends
the which will i not all so much for love
as for another secret close intent
by marrying her which i must reach unto
when they are gone then must i count my gains
set down set down your honourable load
if honour may be shrouded in a hearse
whilst i awhile obsequiously lament
the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
poor keycold figure of a holy king
pale ashes of the house of lancaster
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost
to hear the lamentations of poor anne
wife to thy edward to thy slaughterd son
stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
lo in these windows that let forth thy life
i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes
cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
more direful hap betide that hated wretch
that makes us wretched by the death of thee
than i can wish to adders spiders toads
or any creeping venomd thing that lives
if ever he have child abortive be it
prodigious and untimely brought to light
whose ugly and unnatural aspect
may fright the hopeful mother at the view
and that be heir to his unhappiness
if ever he have wife let her he made
a miserable by the death of him
as i am made by my poor lord and thee
come now towards chertsey with your holy load
taken from pauls to be interred there
and still as you are weary of the weight
rest you whiles i lament king henrys corse
stay you that bear the corse and set it down
what black magician conjures up this fiend
to stop devoted charitable deeds
villains set down the corse or by saint paul
ill make a corse of him that disobeys
my lord stand back and let the coffin pass
advance thy halbert higher than my breast
or by saint paul ill strike thee to my foot
and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
what do you tremble are you all afraid
alas i blame you not for you are mortal
and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
thou hadst but power over his mortal body
his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
sweet saint for charity be not so curst
foul devil for gods sake hence and trouble us not
for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
behold this pattern of thy butcheries
o gentlemen see see dead henrys wounds
open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh
blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
for tis thy presence that exhales this blood
from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
thy deed inhuman and unnatural
provokes this deluge most unnatural
o god which this blood madest revenge his death
o earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death
either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead
or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
as thou dost swallow up this good kings blood
which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered
lady you know no rules of charity
which renders good for bad blessings for curses
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
but i know none and therefore am no beast
o wonderful when devils tell the truth
more wonderful when angels are so angry
vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
of these supposedevils to give me leave
by circumstance but to acquit myself
vouchsafe defused infection of a man
for these known evils but to give me leave
by circumstance to curse thy cursed self
fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
some patient leisure to excuse myself
fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
no excuse current but to hang thyself
by such despair i should accuse myself
and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused
for doing worthy vengeance on thyself
which didst unworthy slaughter upon others
say that i slew them not
but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
i did not kill your husband
why then he is alive
nay he is dead and slain by edwards hand
thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood
the which thou once didst bend against her breast
but that thy brothers beat aside the point
i was provoked by her slanderous tongue
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
didst thou not kill this king
i grant ye
dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too
thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
o he was gentle mild and virtuous
the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him
he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
let him thank me that holp to send him thither
for he was fitter for that place than earth
and thou unfit for any place but hell
yes one place else if you will hear me name it
some dungeon
your bedchamber
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
so will it madam till i lie with you
i hope so
i know so but gentle lady anne
to leave this keen encounter of our wits
and fall somewhat into a slower method
is not the causer of the timeless deaths
of these plantagenets henry and edward
as blameful as the executioner
thou art the cause and most accursed effect
your beauty was the cause of that effect
to undertake the death of all the world
so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom
if i thought that i tell thee homicide
these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
these eyes could never endure sweet beautys wreck
as all the world is cheered by the sun
so i by that it is my day my life
black night oershade thy day and death thy life
curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
i would i were to be revenged on thee
it is a quarrel most unnatural
to be revenged on him that loveth you
it is a quarrel just and reasonable
to be revenged on him that slew my husband
he that bereft thee lady of thy husband
did it to help thee to a better husband
his better doth not breathe upon the earth
he lives that loves thee better than he could
name him
plantagenet
why that was he
the selfsame name but one of better nature
where is he
here
why dost thou spit at me
would it were mortal poison for thy sake
never came poison from so sweet a place
never hung poison on a fouler toad
out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes
thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
i would they were that i might die at once
for now they kill me with a living death
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
these eyes that never shed remorseful tear
no when my father york and edward wept
to hear the piteous moan that rutland made
when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him
nor when thy warlike father like a child
told the sad story of my fathers death
and twenty times made pause to sob and weep
that all the standersby had wet their cheeks
my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
and what these sorrows could not thence exhale
thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
i never sued to friend nor enemy
my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
but now thy beauty is proposed my fee
my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made
for kissing lady not for such contempt
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword
which if thou please to hide in this true bosom
and let the soul forth that adoreth thee
i lay it naked to the deadly stroke
and humbly beg the death upon my knee
nay do not pause for i did kill king henry
but twas thy beauty that provoked me
nay now dispatch twas i that stabbd young edward
but twas thy heavenly face that set me on
take up the sword again or take up me
i will not be the executioner
then bid me kill myself and i will do it
i have already
speak it again and even with the word
that hand which for thy love did kill thy love
shall for thy love kill a far truer love
to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary
i would i knew thy heart
tis figured in my tongue
i fear me both are false
then never man was true
well well put up your sword
say then my peace is made
that shall you know hereafter
but shall i live in hope
all men i hope live so
vouchsafe to wear this ring
to take is not to give
look how this ring encompasseth finger
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
wear both of them for both of them are thine
and if thy poor devoted suppliant may
but beg one favour at thy gracious hand
thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
what is it
that it would please thee leave these sad designs
to him that hath more cause to be a mourner
and presently repair to crosby place
where after i have solemnly interrd
at chertsey monastery this noble king
and wet his grave with my repentant tears
for divers unknown reasons i beseech you
grant me this boon
with all my heart and much it joys me too
to see you are become so penitent
tressel and berkeley go along with me
bid me farewell
tis more than you deserve
but since you teach me how to flatter you
imagine i have said farewell already
sirs take up the corse
towards chertsey noble lord
no to whitefriars there attend my coining
was ever woman in this humour wood
was ever woman in this humour won
ill have her but i will not keep her long
what i that killd her husband and his father
to take her in her hearts extremest hate
with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
the bleeding witness of her hatred by
having god her conscience and these bars
against me
and i nothing to back my suit at all
but the plain devil and dissembling looks
and yet to win her all the world to nothing
ha
hath she forgot already that brave prince
edward her lord whom i some three months since
stabbd in my angry mood at tewksbury
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
framed in the prodigality of nature
young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
the spacious world cannot again afford
and will she yet debase her eyes on me
that croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince
and made her widow to a woful bed
on me whose all not equals edwards moiety
on me that halt and am unshapen thus
my dukedom to a beggarly denier
upon my life she finds although i cannot
myself to be a marvellous proper man
ill be at charges for a lookingglass
and entertain some score or two of tailors
since i am crept in favour with myself
will maintain it with some little cost
but first ill turn yon fellow in his grave
and then return lamenting to my love
shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass
that i may see my shadow as i pass
will soon recover his accustomd health
therefore for gods sake entertain good comfort
and cheer his grace with quick and merry words
if he were dead what would betide of me
no other harm but loss of such a lord
the loss of such a lord includes all harm
the heavens have blessd you with a goodly son
to be your comforter when he is gone
oh he is young and his minority
is put unto the trust of richard gloucester
a man that loves not me nor none of you
is it concluded that he shall be protector
but so it must be if the king miscarry
here come the lords of buckingham and derby
good time of day unto your royal grace
god make your majesty joyful as you have been
the countess richmond good my lord of derby
to your good prayers will scarcely say amen
yet derby notwithstanding shes your wife
and loves not me be you good lord assured
i hate not you for her proud arrogance
i do beseech you either not believe
the envious slanders of her false accusers
or if she be accused in true report
bear with her weakness which i think proceeds
from wayward sickness and no grounded malice
saw you the king today my lord of derby
but now the duke of buckingham and i
are come from visiting his majesty
what likelihood of his amendment lords
madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully
god grant him health did you confer with him
betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers
and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain
and sent to warn them to his royal presence
would all were well but that will never be
i fear our happiness is at the highest
who are they that complain unto the king
that i forsooth am stern and love them not
by holy paul they love his grace but lightly
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
because i cannot flatter and speak fair
smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog
duck with french nods and apish courtesy
i must be held a rancorous enemy
cannot a plain man live and think no harm
but thus his simple truth must be abused
by silken sly insinuating jacks
to whom in all this presence speaks your grace
to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
when have i injured thee when done thee wrong
or thee or thee or any of your faction
a plague upon you all his royal person
whom god preserve better than you would wish
cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile
but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
brother of gloucester you mistake the matter
the king of his own royal disposition
and not provoked by any suitor else
aiming belike at your interior hatred
which in your outward actions shows itself
against my kindred brothers and myself
makes him to send that thereby he may gather
the ground of your illwill and so remove it
since every jack became a gentleman
theres many a gentle person made a jack
come come we know your meaning brother
gloucester
god grant we never may have need of you
your brother is imprisond by your means
myself disgraced and the nobility
held in contempt whilst many fair promotions
are daily given to ennoble those
that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
by him that raised me to this careful height
from that contented hap which i enjoyd
i never did incense his majesty
against the duke of clarence but have been
an earnest advocate to plead for him
my lord you do me shameful injury
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
you may deny that you were not the cause
of my lord hastings late imprisonment
she may my lord for
she may lord rivers why who knows not so
she may help you to many fair preferments
and then deny her aiding hand therein
and lay those honours on your high deserts
what may she not she may yea marry may she
what marry may she
what marry may she marry with a king
i wis your grandam had a worser match
my lord of gloucester i have too long borne
by heaven i will acquaint his majesty
with those gross taunts i often have endured
i had rather be a country servantmaid
than a great queen with this condition
small joy have i in being englands queen
and lessend be that small god i beseech thee
thy honour state and seat is due to me
what threat you me with telling of the king
i dare adventure to be sent to the tower
tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
thou slewest my husband henry in the tower
and edward my poor son at tewksbury
ere you were queen yea or your husband king
i was a packhorse in his great affairs
a weederout of his proud adversaries
to royalize his blood i spilt mine own
yea and much better blood than his or thine
in all which time you and your husband grey
were factious for the house of lancaster
and rivers so were you was not your husband
in margarets battle at saint albans slain
let me put in your minds if you forget
what you have been ere now and what you are
withal what i have been and what i am
a murderous villain and so still thou art
poor clarence did forsake his father warwick
yea and forswore himselfwhich jesu pardon
which god revenge
to fight on edwards party for the crown
and for his meed poor lord he is mewd up
i would to god my heart were flint like edwards
or edwards soft and pitiful like mine
i am too childishfoolish for this world
hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world
thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
my lord of gloucester in those busy days
which here you urge to prove us enemies
so should we you if you should be our king
far be it from my heart the thought of it
as little joy my lord as you suppose
you should enjoy were you this countrys king
as little joy may you suppose in me
that i enjoy being the queen thereof
a little joy enjoys the queen thereof
for i am she and altogether joyless
i can no longer hold me patient
hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
in sharing that which you have pilld from me
which of you trembles not that looks on me
if not that i being queen you bow like subjects
yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels
o gentle villain do not turn away
foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight
but repetition of what thou hast marrd
that will i make before i let thee go
wert thou not banished on pain of death
i was but i do find more pain in banishment
than death can yield me here by my abode
a husband and a son thou owest to me
the sorrow that i have by right is yours
and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
the curse my noble father laid on thee
when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
and with thy scorns drewst rivers from his eyes
and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout
steepd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland
his curses then from bitterness of soul
denounced against thee are all falln upon thee
and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed
so just is god to right the innocent
o twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
and the most merciless that eer was heard of
tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
no man but prophesied revenge for it
northumberland then present wept to see it
what were you snarling all before i came
ready to catch each other by the throat
and turn you all your hatred now on me
did yorks dread curse prevail so much with heaven
that henrys death my lovely edwards death
their kingdoms loss my woful banishment
could all but answer for that peevish brat
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
if not by war by surfeit die your king
as ours by murder to make him a king
edward thy son which now is prince of wales
for edward my son which was prince of wales
die in his youth by like untimely violence
thyself a queen for me that was a queen
outlive thy glory like my wretched self
long mayst thou live to wail thy childrens loss
and see another as i see thee now
deckd in thy rights as thou art stalld in mine
long die thy happy days before thy death
and after many lengthend hours of grief
die neither mother wife nor englands queen
rivers and dorset you were standers by
and so wast thou lord hastings when my son
that none of you may live your natural age
but by some unlookd accident cut off
have done thy charm thou hateful witherd hag
and leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
if heaven have any grievous plague in store
exceeding those that i can wish upon thee
o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
and then hurl down their indignation
on thee the troubler of the poor worlds peace
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest
and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
thou elvishmarkd abortive rooting hog
thou that wast seald in thy nativity
the slave of nature and the son of hell
thou slander of thy mothers heavy womb
thou loathed issue of thy fathers loins
thou rag of honour thou detested
margaret
richard
ha
i call thee not
i cry thee mercy then for i had thought
that thou hadst calld me all these bitter names
why so i did but lookd for no reply
o let me make the period to my curse
tis done by me and ends in margaret
thus have you breathed your curse against yourself
poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
why strewst thou sugar on that bottled spider
whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
fool fool thou whetst a knife to kill thyself
the time will come when thou shalt wish for me
to help thee curse that poisonous bunchbackd toad
falseboding woman end thy frantic curse
lest to thy harm thou move our patience
foul shame upon you you have all moved mine
were you well served you would be taught your duty
to serve me well you all should do me duty
o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
dispute not with her she is lunatic
your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current
o that your young nobility could judge
what twere to lose it and be miserable
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them
and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
it toucheth you my lord as much as me
our aery buildeth in the cedars top
and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
and turns the sun to shade alas alas
witness my son now in the shade of death
whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
hath in eternal darkness folded up
your aery buildeth in our aerys nest
o god that seest it do not suffer it
as it was won with blood lost be it so
have done for shame if not for charity
uncharitably with me have you dealt
and shamefully by you my hopes are butcherd
my charity is outrage life my shame
and in that shame still live my sorrows rage
have done have done
o princely buckingham ill kiss thy hand
now fair befal thee and thy noble house
thy garments are not spotted with our blood
nor thou within the compass of my curse
nor no one here for curses never pass
the lips of those that breathe them in the air
ill not believe but they ascend the sky
and there awake gods gentlesleeping peace
o buckingham take heed of yonder dog
look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
have not to do with him beware of him
sin death and hell have set their marks on him
and all their ministers attend on him
what doth she say my lord of buckingham
nothing that i respect my gracious lord
what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel
and soothe the devil that i warn thee from
o but remember this another day
when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
and say poor margaret was a prophetess
live each of you the subjects to his hate
and he to yours and all of you to gods
my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses
she hath had too much wrong and i repent
my part thereof that i have done to her
i never did her any to my knowledge
but you have all the vantage of her wrong
i was too hot to do somebody good
that is too cold in thinking of it now
marry as for clarence he is well repaid
he is frankd up to fatting for his pains
god pardon them that are the cause of it
a virtuous and a christianlike conclusion
to pray for them that have done scathe to us
being welladvised
for had i cursed now i had cursed myself
madam his majesty doth call for you
and for your grace and you my noble lords
catesby we come lords will you go with us
madam we will attend your grace
i do the wrong and first begin to brawl
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach
i lay unto the grievous charge of others
clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness
i do beweep to many simple gulls
namely to hastings derby buckingham
and say it is the queen and her allies
that stir the king against the duke my brother
now they believe it and withal whet me
but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture
and thus i clothe my naked villany
with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ
and seem a saint when most i play the devil
but soft here come my executioners
how now my hardy stout resolved mates
are you now going to dispatch this deed
we are my lord and come to have the warrant
that we may be admitted where he is
well thought upon i have it here about me
when you have done repair to crosby place
but sirs be sudden in the execution
withal obdurate do not hear him plead
for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him
tush
fear not my lord we will not stand to prate
we come to use our hands and not our tongues
i like you lads about your business straight
go go dispatch
we will my noble lord
why looks your grace so heavily today
o i have passd a miserable night
so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams
that as i am a christian faithful man
i would not spend another such a night
though twere to buy a world of happy days
so full of dismal terror was the time
what was your dream i long to hear you tell it
methoughts that i had broken from the tower
and was embarkd to cross to burgundy
and in my company my brother gloucester
who from my cabin tempted me to walk
and cited up a thousand fearful times
during the wars of york and lancaster
that had befalln us as we paced along
upon the giddy footing of the hatches
methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling
struck me that thought to stay him overboard
into the tumbling billows of the main
lord lord methought what pain it was to drown
what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears
what ugly sights of death within mine eyes
methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks
ten thousand men that fishes gnawd upon
wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
inestimable stones unvalued jewels
some lay in dead mens skulls and in those holes
where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
which wood the slimy bottom of the deep
and mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by
had you such leisure in the time of death
to gaze upon the secrets of the deep
methought i had and often did i strive
kept in my soul and would not let it forth
to seek the empty vast and wandering air
but smotherd it within my panting bulk
which almost burst to belch it in the sea
awaked you not with this sore agony
o no my dream was lengthend after life
o then began the tempest to my soul
who passd methought the melancholy flood
with that grim ferryman which poets write of
unto the kingdom of perpetual night
the first that there did greet my stranger soul
was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick
who cried aloud what scourge for perjury
can this dark monarchy afford false clarence
a shadow like an angel with bright hair
dabbled in blood and he squeakd out aloud
clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence
that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury
seize on him furies take him to your torments
with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
environd me about and howled in mine ears
such hideous cries that with the very noise
i trembling waked and for a season after
could not believe but that i was in hell
such terrible impression made the dream
no marvel my lord though it affrighted you
i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it
o brakenbury i have done those things
which now bear evidence against my soul
for edwards sake and see how he requites me
o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds
yet execute thy wrath in me alone
o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me
my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
makes the night morning and the noontide night
princes have but their tides for their glories
an outward honour for an inward toil
and for unfelt imagination
so that betwixt their tides and low names
theres nothing differs but the outward fame
ho whos here
in gods name what are you and how came you hither
i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs
yea are you so brief
o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show
him our commission talk no more
i am in this commanded to deliver
i will not reason what is meant hereby
because i will be guiltless of the meaning
ill to the king and signify to him
that thus i have resignd my charge to you
what shall we stab him as he sleeps
no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes
when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till
the judgmentday
why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping
the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind
of remorse in me
what art thou afraid
not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be
damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us
i thought thou hadst been resolute
so i am to let him live
back to the duke of gloucester tell him so
will change twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty
how dost thou feel thyself now
faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me
remember our reward when the deed is done
where is thy conscience now
in the duke of gloucesters purse
so when he opens his purse to give us our reward
thy conscience flies out
let it go theres few or none will entertain it
how if it come to thee again
accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him
he cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it
mutinies in a mans bosom it fills one full of
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it
zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me
not to kill the duke
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh
tut i am strongframed he cannot prevail with me
i warrant thee
spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation come shall we to this gear
take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt
in the next room
o excellent devise make a sop of him
no first lets reason with him
where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine
you shall have wine enough my lord anon
in gods name what art thou
a man as you are
but not as i am royal
nor you as we are loyal
thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
my voice is now the kings my looks mine own
how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
who sent you hither wherefore do you come
to to to
to murder me
ay ay
you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
wherein my friends have i offended you
offended us you have not but the king
i shall be reconciled to him again
never my lord therefore prepare to die
are you calld forth from out a world of men
to slay the innocent what is my offence
where are the evidence that do accuse me
what lawful quest have given their verdict up
unto the frowning judge or who pronounced
the bitter sentence of poor clarence death
before i be convict by course of law
to threaten me with death is most unlawful
i charge you as you hope to have redemption
by christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins
that you depart and lay no hands on me
the deed you undertake is damnable
what we will do we do upon command
and he that hath commanded is the king
erroneous vassal the great king of kings
hath in the tables of his law commanded
spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans
take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands
to hurl upon their heads that break his law
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
thou didst receive the holy sacrament
to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster
and like a traitor to the name of god
didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
unripdst the bowels of thy sovereigns son
whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend
how canst thou urge gods dreadful law to us
when thou hast broke it in so dear degree
alas for whose sake did i that ill deed
he sends ye not to murder me for this
for in this sin he is as deep as i
if god will be revenged for this deed
o know you yet he doth it publicly
take not the quarrel from his powerful arm
he needs no indirect nor lawless course
to cut off those that have offended him
who made thee then a bloody minister
when gallantspringing brave plantagenet
that princely novice was struck dead by thee
my brothers love the devil and my rage
thy brothers love our duty and thy fault
provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
oh if you love my brother hate not me
i am his brother and i love him well
if you be hired for meed go back again
and i will send you to my brother gloucester
who shall reward you better for my life
than edward will for tidings of my death
you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you
go you to him from me
ay so we will
tell him when that our princely father york
blessd his three sons with his victorious arm
and charged us from his soul to love each other
bid gloucester think of this and he will weep
ay millstones as be lessond us to weep
o do not slander him for he is kind
right
tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee
it cannot be for when i parted with him
he huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs
that he would labour my delivery
why so he doth now he delivers thee
from this worlds thraldom to the joys of heaven
make peace with god for you must die my lord
hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul
to counsel me to make my peace with god
and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind
that thou wilt war with god by murdering me
ah sirs consider he that set you on
to do this deed will hate you for the deed
what shall we do
relent and save your souls
relent tis cowardly and womanish
not to relent is beastly savage devilish
which of you if you were a princes son
being pent from liberty as i am now
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you
would not entreat for life
o if thine eye be not a flatterer
come thou on my side and entreat for me
as you would beg were you in my distress
a begging prince what beggar pities not
look behind you my lord
ill drown you in the malmseybutt within
a bloody deed and desperately dispatchd
how fain like pilate would i wash my hands
of this most grievous guilty murder done
how now what meanst thou that thou helpst me not
by heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art
i would he knew that i had saved his brother
take thou the fee and tell him what i say
for i repent me that the duke is slain
now must i hide his body in some hole
and when i have my meed i must away
for this will out and here i must not stay
i every day expect an embassage
from my redeemer to redeem me hence
and now in peace my soul shall part to heaven
since i have set my friends at peace on earth
rivers and hastings take each others hand
dissemble not your hatred swear your love
and with my hand i seal my true hearts love
so thrive i as i truly swear the like
take heed you dally not before your king
lest he that is the supreme king of kings
confound your hidden falsehood and award
either of you to be the others end
so prosper i as i swear perfect love
and i as i love hastings with my heart
madam yourself are not exempt in this
nor your son dorset buckingham nor you
you have been factious one against the other
wife love lord hastings let him kiss your hand
and what you do do it unfeignedly
here hastings i will never more remember
our former hatred so thrive i and mine
dorset embrace him hastings love lord marquess
this interchange of love i here protest
upon my part shall be unviolable
and so swear i my lord
now princely buckingham seal thou this league
with thy embracements to my wifes allies
and make me happy in your unity
whenever buckingham doth turn his hate
on you or yours
but with all duteous love
doth cherish you and yours god punish me
with hate in those where i expect most love
when i have most need to employ a friend
and most assured that he is a friend
deep hollow treacherous and full of guile
be he unto me this do i beg of god
when i am cold in zeal to yours
a pleasing cordial princely buckingham
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
there wanteth now our brother gloucester here
to make the perfect period of this peace
and in good time here comes the noble duke
and princely peers a happy time of day
happy indeed as we have spent the day
brother we done deeds of charity
made peace enmity fair love of hate
between these swelling wrongincensed peers
amongst this princely heap if any here
by false intelligence or wrong surmise
hold me a foe
if i unwittingly or in my rage
have aught committed that is hardly borne
by any in this presence i desire
tis death to me to be at enmity
i hate it and desire all good mens love
first madam i entreat true peace of you
which i will purchase with my duteous service
of you my noble cousin buckingham
if ever any grudge were lodged between us
of you lord rivers and lord grey of you
that without desert have frownd on me
dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
i do not know that englishman alive
with whom my soul is any jot at odds
more than the infant that is born tonight
i thank my god for my humility
i would to god all strifes were well compounded
my sovereign liege i do beseech your majesty
to take our brother clarence to your grace
why madam have i offerd love for this
to be so bouted in this royal presence
who knows not that the noble duke is dead
you do him injury to scorn his corse
who knows not he is dead who knows he is
all seeing heaven what a world is this
look i so pale lord dorset as the rest
ay my good lord and no one in this presence
but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
is clarence dead the order was reversed
but he poor soul by your first order died
some tardy cripple bore the countermand
that came too lag to see him buried
god grant that some less noble and less loyal
nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood
deserve not worse than wretched clarence did
and yet go current from suspicion
a boon my sovereign for my service done
i will not rise unless your highness grant
then speak at once what is it thou demandst
the forfeit sovereign of my servants life
who slew today a righteous gentleman
lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
have a tongue to doom my brothers death
and shall the same give pardon to a slave
my brother slew no man his fault was thought
and yet his punishment was cruel death
who sued to me for him who in my rage
kneeld at my feet and bade me be advised
who spake of brotherhood who spake of love
who told me how the poor soul did forsake
the mighty warwick and did fight for me
who told me in the field by tewksbury
when oxford had me down he rescued me
and said dear brother live and be a king
who told me when we both lay in the field
frozen almost to death how he did lap me
even in his own garments and gave himself
all thin and naked to the numb cold night
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
sinfully pluckd and not a man of you
had so much grace to put it in my mind
but when your carters or your waitingvassals
have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
the precious image of our dear redeemer
you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
and i unjustly too must grant it you
but for my brother not a man would speak
nor i ungracious speak unto myself
for him poor soul the proudest of you all
have been beholding to him in his life
yet none of you would once plead for his life
o god i fear thy justice will take hold
on me and you and mine and yours for this
come hastings help me to my closet
oh poor clarence
this is the fruit of rashness markd you not
how that the guilty kindred of the queen
lookd pale when they did hear of clarence death
o they did urge it still unto the king
god will revenge it but come let us in
to comfort edward with our company
we wait upon your grace
tell me good grandam is our father dead
no boy
why do you wring your hands and beat your breast
and cry o clarence my unhappy son
why do you look on us and shake your head
and call us wretches orphans castaways
if that our noble father be alive
my pretty cousins you mistake me much
i do lament the sickness of the king
as loath to lose him not your fathers death
it were lost sorrow to wail one thats lost
then grandam you conclude that he is dead
god will revenge it whom i will importune
with daily prayers all to that effect
and so will i
incapable and shallow innocents
you cannot guess who caused your fathers death
grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester
told me the king provoked by the queen
and when my uncle told me so he wept
and huggd me in his arm and kindly kissd my cheek
bade me rely on him as on my father
and he would love me dearly as his child
oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes
and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile
he is my son yea and therein my shame
yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
ay boy
i cannot think it hark what noise is this
oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep
to chide my fortune and torment myself
ill join with black despair against my soul
and to myself become an enemy
what means this scene of rude impatience
edward my lord your son our king is dead
why grow the branches now the root is witherd
why wither not the leaves the sap being gone
if you will live lament if die be brief
that our swiftwinged souls may catch the kings
or like obedient subjects follow him
to his new kingdom of perpetual rest
ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow
as i had title in thy noble husband
i have bewept a worthy husbands death
but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
are crackd in pieces by malignant death
and i for comfort have but one false glass
which grieves me when i see my shame in him
thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
but death hath snatchd my husband from mine arms
and pluckd two crutches from my feeble limbs
edward and clarence o what cause have i
thine being but a moiety of my grief
to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries
good aunt you wept not for our fathers death
how can we aid you with our kindred tears
our fatherless distress was left unmoand
your widowdolour likewise be unwept
give me no help in lamentation
i am not barren to bring forth complaints
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
that i being governd by the watery moon
may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
oh for my husband for my dear lord edward
oh for our father for our dear lord clarence
alas for both both mine edward and clarence
what stay had i but edward and hes gone
what stay had we but clarence and hes gone
what stays had i but they and they are gone
was never widow had so dear a loss
were never orphans had so dear a loss
was never mother had so dear a loss
alas i am the mother of these moans
their woes are parcelld mine are general
she for an edward weeps and so do i
these babes for clarence weep and so do i
alas you three on me threefold distressd
pour all your tears i am your sorrows nurse
and i will pamper it with lamentations
in common worldly things tis calld ungrateful
with dull unwilligness to repay a debt
which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
much more to be thus opposite with heaven
for it requires the royal debt it lent you
madam bethink you like a careful mother
drown desperate sorrow in dead edwards grave
and plant your joys in living edwards throne
to wail the dimming of our shining star
but none can cure their harms by wailing them
madam my mother i do cry you mercy
i crave your blessing
god bless thee and put meekness in thy mind
love charity obedience and true duty
you cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers
that bear this mutual heavy load of moan
now cheer each other in each others love
though we have spent our harvest of this king
we are to reap the harvest of his son
the broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
but lately splinterd knit and joind together
me seemeth good that with some little train
forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetchd
hither to london to be crownd our king
why with some little train my lord of buckingham
marry my lord lest by a multitude
the newheald wound of malice should break out
which would be so much the more dangerous
where every horse bears his commanding rein
and may direct his course as please himself
as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
in my opinion ought to be prevented
i hope the king made peace with all of us
and the compact is firm and true in me
yet since it is but green it should be put
to no apparent likelihood of breach
therefore i say with noble buckingham
that it is meet so few should fetch the prince
and so say i
then be it so and go we to determine
who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow
madam and you my mother will you go
to give your censures in this weighty business
with all our harts
my lord whoever journeys to the prince
for gods sake let not us two be behind
for by the way ill sort occasion
as index to the story we late talkd of
to part the queens proud kindred from the king
my other self my counsels consistory
my oracle my prophet my dear cousin
i like a child will go by thy direction
towards ludlow then for well not stay behind
hear you the news abroad
ay that the king is dead
i fear i fear twill prove a troublous world
neighbours god speed
give you good morrow sir
doth this news hold of good king edwards death
ay sir it is too true god help the while
then masters look to see a troublous world
no no by gods good grace his son shall reign
woe to the land thats governd by a child
in him there is a hope of government
that in his nonage council under him
and in his full and ripend years himself
no doubt shall then and till then govern well
so stood the state when henry the sixth
was crownd in paris but at nine months old
stood the state so no no good friends god wot
for then this land was famously enrichd
with politic grave counsel then the king
had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
why so hath this both by the father and mother
better it were they all came by the father
or by the father there were none at all
for emulation now who shall be nearest
will touch us all too near if god prevent not
o full of danger is the duke of gloucester
and were they to be ruled and not to rule
this sickly land might solace as before
come come we fear the worst all shall be well
when clouds appear wise men put on their cloaks
when great leaves fall the winter is at hand
when the sun sets who doth not look for night
untimely storms make men expect a dearth
all may be well but if god sort it so
tis more than we deserve or i expect
ye cannot reason almost with a man
that looks not heavily and full of fear
by a divine instinct mens minds mistrust
ensuing dangers as by proof we see
the waters swell before a boisterous storm
but leave it all to god whither away
marry we were sent for to the justices
last night i hear they lay at northampton
tomorrow or next day they will be here
i hope he is much grown since last i saw him
but i hear no they say my son of york
hath almost overtaen him in his growth
ay mother but i would not have it so
why my young cousin it is good to grow
grandam one night as we did sit at supper
my uncle rivers talkd how i did grow
gloucester
and since methinks i would not grow so fast
because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste
good faith good faith the saying did not hold
in him that did object the same to thee
he was the wretchedst thing when he was young
so long agrowing and so leisurely
that if this rule were true he should be gracious
why madam so no doubt he is
i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
now by my troth if i had been rememberd
i could have given my uncles grace a flout
to touch his growth nearer than he touchd mine
how my pretty york i pray thee let me hear it
marry they say my uncle grew so fast
that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
twas full two years ere i could get a tooth
grandam this would have been a biting jest
i pray thee pretty york who told thee this
grandam his nurse
his nurse why she was dead ere thou wert born
if twere not she i cannot tell who told me
good madam be not angry with the child
pitchers have ears
here comes a messenger what news
such news my lord as grieves me to unfold
how fares the prince
well madam and in health
what is thy news then
lord rivers and lord grey are sent to pomfret
with them sir thomas vaughan prisoners
who hath committed them
the mighty dukes
gloucester and buckingham
for what offence
the sum of all i can i have disclosed
why or for what these nobles were committed
is all unknown to me my gracious lady
ay me i see the downfall of our house
the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind
insulting tyranny begins to jet
welcome destruction death and massacre
i see as in a map the end of all
accursed and unquiet wrangling days
how many of you have mine eyes beheld
my husband lost his life to get the crown
and often up and down my sons were tossd
and being seated and domestic broils
clean overblown themselves the conquerors
make war upon themselves blood against blood
and frantic outrage end thy damned spleen
or let me die to look on death no more
come come my boy we will to sanctuary
madam farewell
ill go along with you
you have no cause
my gracious lady go
and thither bear your treasure and your goods
for my part ill resign unto your grace
as well i tender you and all of yours
come ill conduct you to the sanctuary
welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber
welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign
the weary way hath made you melancholy
no uncle but our crosses on the way
have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
i want more uncles here to welcome me
sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years
hath not yet dived into the worlds deceit
nor more can you distinguish of a man
than of his outward show which god he knows
seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
those uncles which you want were dangerous
your grace attended to their sugard words
god keep you from them and from such false friends
god keep me from false friends but they were none
my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you
god bless your grace with health and happy days
i thank you good my lord and thank you all
i thought my mother and my brother york
would long ere this have met us on the way
fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not
to tell us whether they will come or no
and in good time here comes the sweating lord
on what occasion god he knows not i
the queen your mother and your brother york
would fain have come with me to meet your grace
but by his mother was perforce withheld
fie what an indirect and peevish course
is this of hers lord cardinal will your grace
persuade the queen to send the duke of york
unto his princely brother presently
if she deny lord hastings go with him
and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory
can from his mother win the duke of york
anon expect him here but if she be obdurate
to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid
we should infringe the holy privilege
of blessed sanctuary not for all this land
would i be guilty of so deep a sin
you are too senselessobstinate my lord
too ceremonious and traditional
weigh it but with the grossness of this age
you break not sanctuary in seizing him
the benefit thereof is always granted
to those whose dealings have deserved the place
this prince hath neither claimd it nor deserved it
then taking him from thence that is not there
you break no privilege nor charter there
oft have i heard of sanctuary men
but sanctuary children neer till now
my lord you shall oerrule my mind for once
come on lord hastings will you go with me
i go my lord
good lords make all the speedy haste you may
say uncle gloucester if our brother come
where shall we sojourn till our coronation
where it seems best unto your royal self
if i may counsel you some day or two
then where you please and shall be thought most fit
for your best health and recreation
i do not like the tower of any place
did julius caesar build that place my lord
he did my gracious lord begin that place
which since succeeding ages have reedified
is it upon record or else reported
successively from age to age he built it
upon record my gracious lord
but say my lord it were not registerd
methinks the truth should live from age to age
as twere retaild to all posterity
even to the general allending day
what say you uncle
i say without characters fame lives long
thus like the formal vice iniquity
i moralize two meanings in one word
that julius caesar was a famous man
with what his valour did enrich his wit
his wit set down to make his valour live
death makes no conquest of this conqueror
for now he lives in fame though not in life
ill tell you what my cousin buckingham
what my gracious lord
an if i live until i be a man
ill win our ancient right in france again
or die a soldier as i lived a king
now in good time here comes the duke of york
richard of york how fares our loving brother
well my dread lord so must i call you now
too late he died that might have kept that title
which by his death hath lost much majesty
how fares our cousin noble lord of york
i thank you gentle uncle o my lord
you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far
he hath my lord
and therefore is he idle
o my fair cousin i must not say so
then is he more beholding to you than i
he may command me as my sovereign
but you have power in me as in a kinsman
i pray you uncle give me this dagger
my dagger little cousin with all my heart
a beggar brother
of my kind uncle that i know will give
and being but a toy which is no grief to give
a greater gift than that ill give my cousin
a greater gift o thats the sword to it
a gentle cousin were it light enough
o then i see you will part but with light gifts
in weightier things youll say a beggar nay
it is too heavy for your grace to wear
i weigh it lightly were it heavier
what would you have my weapon little lord
i would that i might thank you as you call me
how
little
uncle your grace knows how to bear with him
uncle my brother mocks both you and me
because that i am little like an ape
he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
with what a sharpprovided wit he reasons
to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle
so cunning and so young is wonderful
my lord willt please you pass along
myself and my good cousin buckingham
will to your mother to entreat of her
to meet you at the tower and welcome you
what will you go unto the tower my lord
my lord protector needs will have it so
i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower
why what should you fear
my grandam told me he was murdered there
i fear no uncles dead
nor none that live i hope
an if they live i hope i need not fear
but come my lord and with a heavy heart
thinking on them go i unto the tower
think you my lord this little prating york
was not incensed by his subtle mother
to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
no doubt no doubt o tis a parlous boy
bold quick ingenious forward capable
he is all the mothers from the top to toe
well let them rest come hither catesby
thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
thou knowst our reasons urged upon the way
what thinkst thou is it not an easy matter
to make william lord hastings of our mind
for the instalment of this noble duke
in the seat royal of this famous isle
he for his fathers sake so loves the prince
that he will not be won to aught against him
what thinkst thou then of stanley what will he
he will do all in all as hastings doth
and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings
how doth he stand affected to our purpose
and summon him tomorrow to the tower
to sit about the coronation
if thou dost find him tractable to us
if he be leaden icycold unwilling
be thou so too and so break off your talk
for we tomorrow hold divided councils
wherein thyself shalt highly be employd
his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
tomorrow are let blood at pomfretcastle
and bid my friend for joy of this good news
give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more
good catesby go effect this business soundly
my good lords both with all the heed i may
shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep
you shall my lord
at crosby place there shall you find us both
now my lord what shall we do if we perceive
lord hastings will not yield to our complots
and look when i am king claim thou of me
the earldom of hereford and the moveables
whereof the king my brother stood possessd
ill claim that promise at your graces hands
and look to have it yielded with all willingness
come let us sup betimes that afterwards
we may digest our complots in some form
what ho my lord
a messenger from the lord stanley
what ist oclock
upon the stroke of four
cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights
so it should seem by that i have to say
first he commends him to your noble lordship
and then
and then he sends you word
besides he says there are two councils held
and that may be determined at the one
which may make you and him to rue at the other
therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure
if presently you will take horse with him
and with all speed post with him toward the north
to shun the danger that his soul divines
go fellow go return unto thy lord
bid him not fear the separated councils
his honour and myself are at the one
and at the other is my servant catesby
where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
whereof i shall not have intelligence
and for his dreams i wonder he is so fond
to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
to fly the boar before the boar pursues
were to incense the boar to follow us
and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
go bid thy master rise and come to me
and we will both together to the tower
where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
my gracious lord ill tell him what you say
many good morrows to my noble lord
good morrow catesby you are early stirring
what news what news in this our tottering state
it is a reeling world indeed my lord
and i believe twill never stand upright
tim richard wear the garland of the realm
how wear the garland dost thou mean the crown
ay my good lord
ill have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
ay on my life and hopes to find forward
and thereupon he sends you this good news
that this same very day your enemies
the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret
indeed i am no mourner for that news
but that ill give my voice on richards side
to bar my masters heirs in true descent
god knows i will not do it to the death
god keep your lordship in that gracious mind
but i shall laugh at this a twelvemonth hence
that they who brought me in my masters hate
i live to look upon their tragedy
i tell thee catesby
what my lord
ere a fortnight make me elder
ill send some packing that yet think not on it
tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord
when men are unprepared and look not for it
o monstrous monstrous and so falls it out
with some men else who think themselves as safe
as thou and i who as thou knowst are dear
to princely richard and to buckingham
the princes both make high account of you
for they account his head upon the bridge
i know they do and i have well deserved it
come on come on where is your boarspear man
fear you the boar and go so unprovided
you may jest on but by the holy rood
i do not like these several councils i
my lord
i hold my life as dear as you do yours
and never in my life i do protest
think you but that i know our state secure
i would be so triumphant as i am
the lords at pomfret when they rode from london
were jocund and supposed their state was sure
and they indeed had no cause to mistrust
but yet you see how soon the day oercast
pray god i say i prove a needless coward
what shall we toward the tower the day is spent
come come have with you wot you what my lord
today the lords you talk of are beheaded
they for their truth might better wear their heads
than some that have accused them wear their hats
but come my lord let us away
go on before ill talk with this good fellow
how now sirrah how goes the world with thee
the better that your lordship please to ask
i tell thee man tis better with me now
then was i going prisoner to the tower
by the suggestion of the queens allies
but now i tell theekeep it to thyself
this day those enemies are put to death
and i in better state than eer i was
god hold it to your honours good content
god save your lordship
well met my lord i am glad to see your honour
i thank thee good sir john with all my heart
i am in your debt for your last exercise
come the next sabbath and i will content you
what talking with a priest lord chamberlain
your friends at pomfret they do need the priest
your honour hath no shriving work in hand
good faith and when i met this holy man
those men you talk of came into my mind
what go you toward the tower
i do my lord but long i shall not stay
i shall return before your lordship thence
tis like enough for i stay dinner there
ill wait upon your lordship
come bring forth the prisoners
today shalt thou behold a subject die
for truth for duty and for loyalty
god keep the prince from all the pack of you
a knot you are of damned bloodsuckers
you live that shall cry woe for this after
dispatch the limit of your lives is out
o pomfret pomfret o thou bloody prison
fatal and ominous to noble peers
within the guilty closure of thy walls
richard the second here was hackd to death
and for more slander to thy dismal seat
we give thee up our guiltless blood to drink
now margarets curse is falln upon our heads
for standing by when richard stabbd her son
then cursed she hastings then cursed she buckingham
then cursed she richard o remember god
to hear her prayers for them as now for us
and for my sister and her princely sons
be satisfied dear god with our true blood
which as thou knowst unjustly must be spilt
make haste the hour of death is expiate
and take our leave until we meet in heaven
is to determine of the coronation
are all things fitting for that royal time
it is and wants but nomination
tomorrow then i judge a happy day
who knows the lord protectors mind herein
who is most inward with the royal duke
your grace we think should soonest know his mind
who i my lord i we know each others faces
but for our hearts he knows no more of mine
than i of yours
nor i no more of his than you of mine
lord hastings you and he are near in love
i thank his grace i know he loves me well
but for his purpose in the coronation
i have not sounded him nor he deliverd
but you my noble lords may name the time
and in the dukes behalf ill give my voice
which i presume hell take in gentle part
now in good time here comes the duke himself
my noble lords and cousins all good morrow
i have been long a sleeper but i hope
my absence doth neglect no great designs
which by my presence might have been concluded
had not you come upon your cue my lord
william lord hastings had pronounced your part
i mean your voicefor crowning of the king
than my lord hastings no man might be bolder
his lordship knows me well and loves me well
i thank your grace
my lord of ely
my lord
when i was last in holborn
i saw good strawberries in your garden there
i do beseech you send for some of them
marry and will my lord with all my heart
cousin of buckingham a word with you
catesby hath sounded hastings in our business
and finds the testy gentleman so hot
as he will lose his head ere give consent
his masters son as worshipful as he terms it
shall lose the royalty of englands throne
withdraw you hence my lord ill follow you
we have not yet set down this day of triumph
tomorrow in mine opinion is too sudden
for i myself am not so well provided
as else i would be were the day prolongd
where is my lord protector i have sent for these
strawberries
his grace looks cheerfully and smooth today
theres some conceit or other likes him well
when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit
i think theres never a man in christendom
that can less hide his love or hate than he
for by his face straight shall you know his heart
what of his heart perceive you in his face
by any likelihood he showd today
marry that with no man here he is offended
for were he he had shown it in his looks
i pray god he be not i say
i pray you all tell me what they deserve
that do conspire my death with devilish plots
of damned witchcraft and that have prevaild
upon my body with their hellish charms
the tender love i bear your grace my lord
makes me most forward in this noble presence
to doom the offenders whatsoever they be
i say my lord they have deserved death
see how i am bewitchd behold mine arm
and this is edwards wife that monstrous witch
consorted with that harlot strumpet shore
that by their witchcraft thus have marked me
if they have done this thing my gracious lord
if i thou protector of this damned strumpet
off with his head now by saint paul i swear
i will not dine until i see the same
the rest that love me rise and follow me
woe woe for england not a whit for me
for i too fond might have prevented this
stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm
three times today my footcloth horse did stumble
and startled when he lookd upon the tower
as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse
i now repent i told the pursuivant
as twere triumphing at mine enemies
how they at pomfret bloodily were butcherd
and i myself secure in grace and favour
o margaret margaret now thy heavy curse
is lighted on poor hastings wretched head
make a short shrift he longs to see your head
o momentary grace of mortal men
which we more hunt for than the grace of god
who builds his hopes in air of your good looks
lives like a drunken sailor on a mast
ready with every nod to tumble down
into the fatal bowels of the deep
come come dispatch tis bootless to exclaim
o bloody richard miserable england
i prophesy the fearfulst time to thee
that ever wretched age hath lookd upon
come lead me to the block bear him my head
they smile at me that shortly shall be dead
come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour
murder thy breath in the middle of a word
and then begin again and stop again
as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror
tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian
speak and look back and pry on every side
tremble and start at wagging of a straw
are at my service like enforced smiles
and both are ready in their offices
at any time to grace my stratagems
but what is catesby gone
he is and see he brings the mayor along
lord mayor
look to the drawbridge there
hark a drum
catesby oerlook the walls
lord mayor the reason we have sent
look back defend thee here are enemies
god and our innocency defend and guard us
be patient they are friends ratcliff and lovel
here is the head of that ignoble traitor
the dangerous and unsuspected hastings
so dear i loved the man that i must weep
i took him for the plainest harmless creature
that breathed upon this earth a christian
made him my book wherein my soul recorded
so smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue
that his apparent open guilt omitted
i mean his conversation with shores wife
he lived from all attainder of suspect
well well he was the covertst shelterd traitor
that ever lived
would you imagine or almost believe
weret not that by great preservation
we live to tell it you the subtle traitor
this day had plotted in the councilhouse
to murder me and my good lord of gloucester
what had he so
what think you we are turks or infidels
or that we would against the form of law
proceed thus rashly to the villains death
but that the extreme peril of the case
the peace of england and our persons safety
enforced us to this execution
now fair befall you he deserved his death
and you my good lords both have well proceeded
to warn false traitors from the like attempts
i never lookd for better at his hands
after he once fell in with mistress shore
yet had not we determined he should die
until your lordship came to see his death
which now the loving haste of these our friends
because my lord we would have had you heard
the traitor speak and timorously confess
the manner and the purpose of his treason
that you might well have signified the same
unto the citizens who haply may
misconstrue us in him and wail his death
but my good lord your graces word shall serve
as well as i had seen and heard him speak
and doubt you not right noble princes both
but ill acquaint our duteous citizens
with all your just proceedings in this cause
and to that end we wishd your lordship here
to avoid the carping censures of the world
but since you come too late of our intents
and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell
go after after cousin buckingham
there at your meetst advantage of the time
tell them how edward put to death a citizen
only for saying he would make his son
heir to the crown meaning indeed his house
which by the sign thereof was termed so
moreover urge his hateful luxury
and bestial appetite in change of lust
which stretched to their servants daughters wives
even where his lustful eye or savage heart
without control listed to make his prey
tell them when that my mother went with child
of that unsatiate edward noble york
my princely father then had wars in france
and by just computation of the time
found that the issue was not his begot
which well appeared in his lineaments
but touch this sparingly as twere far off
because you know my lord my mother lives
fear not my lord ill play the orator
as if the golden fee for which i plead
if you thrive well bring them to baynards castle
where you shall find me well accompanied
with reverend fathers and welllearned bishops
look for the news that the guildhall affords
go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw
go thou to friar penker bid them both
meet me within this hour at baynards castle
now will i in to take some privy order
to draw the brats of clarence out of sight
and to give notice that no manner of person
at any time have recourse unto the princes
this is the indictment of the good lord hastings
which in a set hand fairly is engrossd
that it may be this day read over in pauls
eleven hours i spent to write it over
for yesternight by catesby was it brought me
and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings
untainted unexamined free at liberty
heres a good world the while why whos so gross
that seeth not this palpable device
yet whos so blind but says he sees it not
bad is the world and all will come to nought
when such bad dealings must be seen in thought
how now my lord what say the citizens
now by the holy mother of our lord
the citizens are mum and speak not a word
touchd you the bastardy of edwards children
i did with his contract with lady lucy
and his contract by deputy in france
the insatiate greediness of his desires
and his enforcement of the city wives
his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy
as being got your father then in france
his resemblance being not like the duke
withal i did infer your lineaments
being the right idea of your father
both in your form and nobleness of mind
laid open all your victories in scotland
your dicipline in war wisdom in peace
indeed left nothing fitting for the purpose
untouchd or slightly handled in discourse
and when mine oratory grew to an end
i bid them that did love their countrys good
cry god save richard englands royal king
ah and did they so
no so god help me they spake not a word
but like dumb statues or breathing stones
gazed each on other and lookd deadly pale
which when i saw i reprehended them
his answer was the people were not wont
to be spoke to but by the recorder
then he was urged to tell my tale again
thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd
but nothing spake in warrant from himself
when he had done some followers of mine own
at the lower end of the hall hurld up their caps
and some ten voices cried god save king richard
and thus i took the vantage of those few
thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i
this general applause and loving shout
and even here brake off and came away
what tongueless blocks were they would not they speak
no by my troth my lord
will not the mayor then and his brethren come
and look you get a prayerbook in your hand
and stand betwixt two churchmen good my lord
play the maids part still answer nay and take it
i go and if you plead as well for them
as i can say nay to thee for myself
no doubt well bring it to a happy issue
go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks
welcome my lord i dance attendance here
i think the duke will not be spoke withal
what says he
he is within with two right reverend fathers
divinely bent to meditation
and no worldly suit would he be moved
to draw him from his holy exercise
return good catesby to thy lord again
tell him myself the mayor and citizens
in deep designs and matters of great moment
no less importing than our general good
are come to have some conference with his grace
ill tell him what you say my lord
ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward
he is not lolling on a lewd daybed
but on his knees at meditation
not dallying with a brace of courtezans
but meditating with two deep divines
not sleeping to engross his idle body
happy were england would this gracious prince
but sure i fear we shall neer win him to it
marry god forbid his grace should say us nay
i fear he will
how now catesby what says your lord
my lord
he wonders to what end you have assembled
such troops of citizens to speak with him
my lord he fears you mean no good to him
sorry i am my noble cousin should
by heaven i come in perfect love to him
and so once more return and tell his grace
when holy and devout religious men
are at their beads tis hard to draw them thence
so sweet is zealous contemplation
see where he stands between two clergymen
two props of virtue for a christian prince
and see a book of prayer in his hand
true ornaments to know a holy man
famous plantagenet most gracious prince
lend favourable ears to our request
and pardon us the interruption
of thy devotion and right christian zeal
i rather do beseech you pardon me
who earnest in the service of my god
neglect the visitation of my friends
but leaving this what is your graces pleasure
even that i hope which pleaseth god above
and all good men of this ungovernd isle
i do suspect i have done some offence
that seems disgracious in the citys eyes
and that you come to reprehend my ignorance
at our entreaties to amend that fault
else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
then know it is your fault that you resign
the supreme seat the throne majestical
the scepterd office of your ancestors
your state of fortune and your due of birth
the lineal glory of your royal house
whilst in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
which here we waken to our countrys good
this noble isle doth want her proper limbs
her face defaced with scars of infamy
her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
and almost shoulderd in the swallowing gulf
of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion
which to recure we heartily solicit
your gracious self to take on you the charge
and kingly government of this your land
not as protector steward substitute
or lowly factor for anothers gain
but as successively from blood to blood
your right of birth your empery your own
for this consorted with the citizens
your very worshipful and loving friends
and by their vehement instigation
in this just suit come i to move your grace
i know not whether to depart in silence
or bitterly to speak in your reproof
best fitteth my degree or your condition
if not to answer you might haply think
tonguetied ambition not replying yielded
to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
which fondly you would here impose on me
if to reprove you for this suit of yours
so seasond with your faithful love to me
then on the other side i chequed my friends
therefore to speak and to avoid the first
and then in speaking not to incur the last
definitively thus i answer you
your love deserves my thanks but my desert
unmeritable shuns your high request
first if all obstacles were cut away
and that my path were even to the crown
as my ripe revenue and due by birth
yet so much is my poverty of spirit
so mighty and so many my defects
as i had rather hide me from my greatness
being a bark to brook no mighty sea
than in my greatness covet to be hid
and in the vapour of my glory smotherd
but god be thankd theres no need of me
and much i need to help you if need were
the royal tree hath left us royal fruit
which mellowd by the stealing hours of time
will well become the seat of majesty
and make no doubt us happy by his reign
on him i lay what you would lay on me
the right and fortune of his happy stars
which god defend that i should wring from him
my lord this argues conscience in your grace
but the respects thereof are nice and trivial
all circumstances well considered
so say we too but not by edwards wife
for first he was contract to lady lucy
your mother lives a witness to that vow
and afterward by substitute betrothd
to bona sister to the king of france
these both put by a poor petitioner
a carecrazed mother of a many children
a beautywaning and distressed widow
even in the afternoon of her best days
made prize and purchase of his lustful eye
seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
to base declension and loathed bigamy
by her in his unlawful bed he got
this edward whom our manners term the prince
more bitterly could i expostulate
save that for reverence to some alive
i give a sparing limit to my tongue
then good my lord take to your royal self
this profferd benefit of dignity
if non to bless us and the land withal
yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
from the corruption of abusing times
unto a lineal truederived course
do good my lord your citizens entreat you
refuse not mighty lord this profferd love
o make them joyful grant their lawful suit
alas why would you heap these cares on me
i am unfit for state and majesty
i do beseech you take it not amiss
i cannot nor i will not yield to you
if you refuse itas in love and zeal
loath to depose the child your brothers son
as well we know your tenderness of heart
and gentle kind effeminate remorse
which we have noted in you to your kin
and egally indeed to all estates
yet whether you accept our suit or no
your brothers son shall never reign our king
but we will plant some other in the throne
and in this resolution here we leave you
o do not swear my lord of buckingham
call them again my lord and accept their suit
do good my lord lest all the land do rue it
would you enforce me to a world of care
well call them again i am not made of stone
but penetrable to your kind entreats
albeit against my conscience and my soul
cousin of buckingham and you sage grave men
since you will buckle fortune on my back
to bear her burthen whether i will or no
but if black scandal or foulfaced reproach
attend the sequel of your imposition
your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
from all the impure blots and stains thereof
for god he knows and you may partly see
how far i am from the desire thereof
god bless your grace we see it and will say it
in saying so you shall but say the truth
long live richard englands royal king
amen
tomorrow will it please you to be crownd
even when you please since you will have it so
and so most joyfully we take our leave
come let us to our holy task again
farewell good cousin farewell gentle friends
who meets us here  my niece plantagenet
led in the hand of her kind aunt of gloucester
now for my life shes wandering to the tower
on pure hearts love to greet the tender princes
daughter well met
god give your graces both
a happy and a joyful time of day
as much to you good sister whither away
no farther than the tower and as i guess
upon the like devotion as yourselves
to gratulate the gentle princes there
and in good time here the lieutenant comes
master lieutenant pray you by your leave
how doth the prince and my young son of york
right well dear madam by your patience
i may not suffer you to visit them
the king hath straitly charged the contrary
the king why whos that
the lord protect him from that kingly title
hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me
i am their mother who should keep me from them
i am their fathers mother i will see them
then bring me to their sights ill bear thy blame
and take thy office from thee on my peril
i am bound by oath and therefore pardon me
let me but meet you ladies one hour hence
and ill salute your grace of york as mother
and reverend looker on of two fair queens
come madam you must straight to westminster
there to be crowned richards royal queen
o cut my lace in sunder that my pent heart
may have some scope to beat or else i swoon
with this deadkilling news
despiteful tidings o unpleasing news
o dorset speak not to me get thee hence
death and destruction dog thee at the heels
thy mothers name is ominous to children
if thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas
and live with richmond from the reach of hell
go hie thee hie thee from this slaughterhouse
lest thou increase the number of the dead
and make me die the thrall of margarets curse
nor mother wife nor englands counted queen
full of wise care is this your counsel madam
take all the swift advantage of the hours
you shall have letters from me to my son
to meet you on the way and welcome you
be not taen tardy by unwise delay
o illdispersing wind of misery
o my accursed womb the bed of death
a cockatrice hast thou hatchd to the world
whose unavoided eye is murderous
come madam come i in all haste was sent
and i in all unwillingness will go
i would to god that the inclusive verge
of golden metal that must round my brow
were redhot steel to sear me to the brain
anointed let me be with deadly venom
and die ere men can say god save the queen
go go poor soul i envy not thy glory
to feed my humour wish thyself no harm
no why  when he that is my husband now
came to me as i followd henrys corse
when scarce the blood was well washd from his hands
which issued from my other angel husband
and that dead saint which then i weeping followd
o when i say i lookd on richards face
for making me so young so old a widow
and when thou wedst let sorrow haunt thy bed
and be thy wifeif any be so mad
as miserable by the life of thee
as thou hast made me by my dear lords death
lo ere i can repeat this curse again
even in so short a space my womans heart
grossly grew captive to his honey words
and proved the subject of my own souls curse
which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest
for never yet one hour in his bed
have i enjoyd the golden dew of sleep
but have been waked by his timorous dreams
besides he hates me for my father warwick
and will no doubt shortly be rid of me
poor heart adieu i pity thy complaining
no more than from my soul i mourn for yours
farewell thou woful welcomer of glory
adieu poor soul that takest thy leave of it
stay yet look back with me unto the tower
pity you ancient stones those tender babes
whom envy hath immured within your walls
rough cradle for such little pretty ones
rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow
for tender princes use my babies well
so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell
stand all apart cousin of buckingham
my gracious sovereign
give me thy hand
thus high by thy advice
and thy assistance is king richard seated
but shall we wear these honours for a day
or shall they last and we rejoice in them
still live they and for ever may they last
o buckingham now do i play the touch
to try if thou be current gold indeed
say on my loving lord
why buckingham i say i would be king
why so you are my thrice renowned liege
true noble prince
o bitter consequence
that edward still should live true noble prince
shall i be plain i wish the bastards dead
and i would have it suddenly performd
what sayest thou speak suddenly be brief
your grace may do your pleasure
say have i thy consent that they shall die
give me some breath some little pause my lord
i will resolve your grace immediately
i will converse with ironwitted fools
highreaching buckingham grows circumspect
boy
my lord
knowst thou not any whom corrupting gold
would tempt unto a close exploit of death
my lord i know a discontented gentleman
gold were as good as twenty orators
and will no doubt tempt him to any thing
what is his name
his name my lord is tyrrel
the deeprevolving witty buckingham
hath he so long held out with me untired
and stops he now for breath
how now what news with you
my lord i hear the marquis dorsets fled
to richmond in those parts beyond the sea
where he abides
catesby
my lord
rumour it abroad
i will take order for her keeping close
inquire me out some meanborn gentleman
the boy is foolish and i fear not him
look how thou dreamst i say again give out
about it for it stands me much upon
to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me
i must be married to my brothers daughter
or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass
murder her brothers and then marry her
uncertain way of gain but i am in
tearfalling pity dwells not in this eye
is thy name tyrrel
james tyrrel and your most obedient subject
art thou indeed
prove me my gracious sovereign
darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine
ay my lord
but i had rather kill two enemies
foes to my rest and my sweet sleeps disturbers
tyrrel i mean those bastards in the tower
let me have open means to come to them
and soon ill rid you from the fear of them
thou singst sweet music hark come hither tyrrel
and i will love thee and prefer thee too
tis done my gracious lord
shall we hear from thee tyrrel ere we sleep
ye shall my lord
my lord i have considerd in my mind
the late demand that you did sound me in
well let that pass dorset is fled to richmond
i hear that news my lord
stanley he is your wifes son well look to it
my lord i claim your gift my due by promise
for which your honour and your faith is pawnd
the earldom of hereford and the moveables
the which you promised i should possess
stanley look to your wife if she convey
letters to richmond you shall answer it
what says your highness to my just demand
as i remember henry the sixth
did prophesy that richmond should be king
when richmond was a little peevish boy
a king perhaps perhaps
my lord
how chance the prophet could not at that time
have told me i being by that i should kill him
my lord your promise for the earldom
richmond when last i was at exeter
the mayor in courtesy showd me the castle
because a bard of ireland told me once
i should not live long after i saw richmond
my lord
ay whats oclock
i am thus bold to put your grace in mind
of what you promised me
well but whats oclock
upon the stroke of ten
well let it strike
why let it strike
because that like a jack thou keepst the stroke
betwixt thy begging and my meditation
i am not in the giving vein today
why then resolve me whether you will or no
tut tut
thou troublest me am not in the vein
is it even so rewards he my true service
with such deep contempt made i him king for this
o let me think on hastings and be gone
to brecknock while my fearful head is on
the tyrannous and bloody deed is done
the most arch of piteous massacre
that ever yet this land was guilty of
dighton and forrest whom i did suborn
to do this ruthless piece of butchery
although they were fleshd villains bloody dogs
melting with tenderness and kind compassion
wept like two children in their deaths sad stories
thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another
their lips were four red roses on a stalk
which in their summer beauty kissd each other
a book of prayers on their pillow lay
which once quoth forrest almost changed my mind
but o the devilthere the villain stoppd
the most replenished sweet work of nature
that from the prime creation eer she framed
thus both are gone with conscience and remorse
they could not speak and so i left them both
to bring this tidings to the bloody king
and here he comes
all hail my sovereign liege
kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news
if to have done the thing you gave in charge
beget your happiness be happy then
for it is done my lord
but didst thou see them dead
i did my lord
and buried gentle tyrrel
the chaplain of the tower hath buried them
but how or in what place i do not know
come to me tyrrel soon at after supper
and thou shalt tell the process of their death
meantime but think how i may do thee good
and be inheritor of thy desire
farewell till soon
the son of clarence have i pent up close
his daughter meanly have i matchd in marriage
the sons of edward sleep in abrahams bosom
and anne my wife hath bid the world good night
now for i know the breton richmond aims
at young elizabeth my brothers daughter
and by that knot looks proudly oer the crown
to her i go a jolly thriving wooer
my lord
good news or bad that thou comest in so bluntly
and buckingham backd with the hardy welshmen
is in the field and still his power increaseth
ely with richmond troubles me more near
than buckingham and his rashlevied army
come i have heard that fearful commenting
is leaden servitor to dull delay
delay leads impotent and snailpaced beggary
then fiery expedition be my wing
joves mercury and herald for a king
we must be brief when traitors brave the field
so now prosperity begins to mellow
and drop into the rotten mouth of death
here in these confines slily have i lurkd
to watch the waning of mine adversaries
a dire induction am i witness to
and will to france hoping the consequence
will prove as bitter black and tragical
ah my young princes ah my tender babes
my unblown flowers newappearing sweets
if yet your gentle souls fly in the air
and be not fixd in doom perpetual
hover about me with your airy wings
and hear your mothers lamentation
hover about her say that right for right
hath dimmd your infant morn to aged night
so many miseries have crazed my voice
that my woewearied tongue is mute and dumb
edward plantagenet why art thou dead
plantagenet doth quit plantagenet
edward for edward pays a dying debt
wilt thou o god fly from such gentle lambs
and throw them in the entrails of the wolf
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done
when holy harry died and my sweet son
blind sight dead life poor mortal living ghost
woes scene worlds shame graves due by life usurpd
brief abstract and record of tedious days
rest thy unrest on englands lawful earth
unlawfully made drunk with innocents blood
o that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
as thou canst yield a melancholy seat
then would i hide my bones not rest them here
o who hath any cause to mourn but i
if ancient sorrow be most reverend
give mine the benefit of seniory
and let my woes frown on the upper hand
if sorrow can admit society
i had an edward till a richard killd him
thou hadst an edward till a richard killd him
thou hadst a richard till a richard killed him
i had a richard too and thou didst kill him
i had a rutland too thou holpst to kill him
thou hadst a clarence too and richard killd him
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
that dog that had his teeth before his eyes
to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood
that foul defacer of gods handiwork
that excellent grand tyrant of the earth
that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls
thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
o upright just and truedisposing god
how do i thank thee that this carnal cur
preys on the issue of his mothers body
and makes her pewfellow with others moan
o harrys wife triumph not in my woes
god witness with me i have wept for thine
bear with me i am hungry for revenge
and now i cloy me with beholding it
thy other edward dead to quit my edward
young york he is but boot because both they
thy clarence he is dead that killd my edward
and the beholders of this tragic play
the adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey
untimely smotherd in their dusky graves
richard yet lives hells black intelligencer
only reserved their factor to buy souls
earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray
to have him suddenly conveyd away
cancel his bond of life dear god i prey
that i may live to say the dog is dead
o thou didst prophesy the time would come
that i should wish for thee to help me curse
that bottled spider that foul bunchbackd toad
i calld thee then vain flourish of my fortune
i calld thee then poor shadow painted queen
the presentation of but what i was
the flattering index of a direful pageant
one heaved ahigh to be hurld down below
a mother only mockd with two sweet babes
a dream of what thou wert a breath a bubble
a sign of dignity a garish flag
to be the aim of every dangerous shot
a queen in jest only to fill the scene
where is thy husband now where be thy brothers
where are thy children wherein dost thou joy
who sues to thee and cries god save the queen
where be the bending peers that flatterd thee
where be the thronging troops that followd thee
for happy wife a most distressed widow
for joyful mother one that wails the name
for queen a very caitiff crownd with care
for one being sued to one that humbly sues
for one that scornd at me now scornd of me
for one being feard of all now fearing one
for one commanding all obeyd of none
thus hath the course of justice wheeld about
and left thee but a very prey to time
having no more but thought of what thou wert
to torture thee the more being what thou art
thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not
usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
now thy proud neck bears half my burthend yoke
from which even here i slip my weary neck
and leave the burthen of it all on thee
these english woes will make me smile in france
o thou well skilld in curses stay awhile
and teach me how to curse mine enemies
forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days
compare dead happiness with living woe
think that thy babes were fairer than they were
revolving this will teach thee how to curse
my words are dull o quicken them with thine
thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
why should calamity be full of words
windy attorneys to their client woes
airy succeeders of intestate joys
poor breathing orators of miseries
help not all yet do they ease the heart
and in the breath of bitter words lets smother
my damned son which thy two sweet sons smotherd
who intercepts my expedition
o she that might have intercepted thee
by strangling thee in her accursed womb
from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done
hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown
where should be graven if that right were right
the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown
and the dire death of my two sons and brothers
tell me thou villain slave where are my children
thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence
and little ned plantagenet his son
where is kind hastings rivers vaughan grey
a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums
let not the heavens hear these telltale women
either be patient and entreat me fair
or with the clamorous report of war
thus will i drown your exclamations
art thou my son
ay i thank god my father and yourself
then patiently hear my impatience
madam i have a touch of your condition
which cannot brook the accent of reproof
o let me speak
i will be mild and gentle in my speech
and brief good mother for i am in haste
art thou so hasty i have stayd for thee
god knows in anguish pain and agony
and came i not at last to comfort you
no by the holy rood thou knowst it well
thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell
a grievous burthen was thy birth to me
tetchy and wayward was thy infancy
thy schooldays frightful desperate wild and furious
thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous
thy age confirmd proud subdued bloody
treacherous
what comfortable hour canst thou name
that ever graced me in thy company
faith none but humphrey hour that calld
your grace
to breakfast once forth of my company
if i be so disgracious in your sight
let me march on and not offend your grace
strike the drum
i prithee hear me speak
you speak too bitterly
hear me a word
for i shall never speak to thee again
so
either thou wilt die by gods just ordinance
ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
or i with grief and extreme age shall perish
and never look upon thy face again
therefore take with thee my most heavy curse
which in the day of battle tire thee more
than all the complete armour that thou wearst
my prayers on the adverse party fight
and there the little souls of edwards children
whisper the spirits of thine enemies
and promise them success and victory
bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse
abides in me i say amen to all
stay madam i must speak a word with you
i have no more sons of the royal blood
they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens
and therefore level not to hit their lives
you have a daughter calld elizabeth
virtuous and fair royal and gracious
and must she die for this o let her live
and ill corrupt her manners stain her beauty
slander myself as false to edwards bed
so she may live unscarrd of bleeding slaughter
i will confess she was not edwards daughter
wrong not her birth she is of royal blood
to save her life ill say she is not so
her life is only safest in her birth
and only in that safety died her brothers
lo at their births good stars were opposite
no to their lives bad friends were contrary
all unavoided is the doom of destiny
my babes were destined to a fairer death
if grace had blessd thee with a fairer life
you speak as if that i had slain my cousins
cousins indeed and by their uncle cozend
of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts
no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart
to revel in the entrails of my lambs
but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame
my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes
and i in such a desperate bay of death
like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft
rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
madam so thrive i in my enterprise
and dangerous success of bloody wars
as i intend more good to you and yours
than ever you or yours were by me wrongd
what good is coverd with the face of heaven
to be discoverd that can do me good
the advancement of your children gentle lady
up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
no to the dignity and height of honour
the high imperial type of this earths glory
flatter my sorrows with report of it
tell me what state what dignity what honour
canst thou demise to any child of mine
even all i have yea and myself and all
will i withal endow a child of thine
so in the lethe of thy angry soul
thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
which thou supposest i have done to thee
be brief lest that be process of thy kindness
last longer telling than thy kindness date
then know that from my soul i love thy daughter
my daughters mother thinks it with her soul
what do you think
so from thy souls love didst thou love her brothers
and from my hearts love i do thank thee for it
i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter
and mean to make her queen of england
say then who dost thou mean shall be her king
even he that makes her queen who should be else
what thou
how canst thou woo her
that would i learn of you
as one that are best acquainted with her humour
and wilt thou learn of me
madam with all my heart
send to her by the man that slew her brothers
a pair of bleedinghearts thereon engrave
therefore present to heras sometime margaret
did to thy father steepd in rutlands blood
a handkerchief which say to her did drain
the purple sap from her sweet brothers body
and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith
if this inducement force her not to love
send her a story of thy noble acts
tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence
her uncle rivers yea and for her sake
madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
come come you mock me this is not the way
to win our daughter
there is no other way
unless thou couldst put on some other shape
and not be richard that hath done all this
say that i did all this for love of her
nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee
having bought love with such a bloody spoil
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
which after hours give leisure to repent
if i did take the kingdom from your sons
to make amends ill give it to your daughter
if i have killd the issue of your womb
to quicken your increase i will beget
mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
a grandams name is little less in love
than is the doting title of a mother
they are as children but one step below
even of your mettle of your very blood
of an one pain save for a night of groans
endured of her for whom you bid like sorrow
your children were vexation to your youth
but mine shall be a comfort to your age
the loss you have is but a son being king
and by that loss your daughter is made queen
i cannot make you what amends i would
therefore accept such kindness as i can
dorset your son that with a fearful soul
leads discontented steps in foreign soil
this fair alliance quickly shall call home
the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife
familiarly shall call thy dorset brother
again shall you be mother to a king
and all the ruins of distressful times
repaird with double riches of content
the liquid drops of tears that you have shed
shall come again transformd to orient pearl
advantaging their loan with interest
of ten times double gain of happiness
go then my mother to thy daughter go
make bold her bashful years with your experience
prepare her ears to hear a wooers tale
put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
of golden sovereignty acquaint the princess
with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
and when this arm of mine hath chastised
the petty rebel dullbraind buckingham
bound with triumphant garlands will i come
and lead thy daughter to a conquerors bed
to whom i will retail my conquest won
and she shall be sole victress caesars caesar
what were i best to say her fathers brother
would be her lord or shall i say her uncle
or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
under what title shall i woo for thee
that god the law my honour and her love
can make seem pleasing to her tender years
infer fair englands peace by this alliance
which she shall purchase with still lasting war
say that the king which may command entreats
that at her hands which the kings king forbids
say she shall be a high and mighty queen
to wail the tide as her mother doth
say i will love her everlastingly
but how long shall that title ever last
sweetly in force unto her fair lifes end
but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last
so long as heaven and nature lengthens it
so long as hell and richard likes of it
say i her sovereign am her subject love
but she your subject loathes such sovereignty
be eloquent in my behalf to her
an honest tale speeds best being plainly told
then in plain terms tell her my loving tale
plain and not honest is too harsh a style
your reasons are too shallow and too quick
o no my reasons are too deep and dead
too deep and dead poor infants in their grave
harp not on that string madam that is past
harp on it still shall i till heartstrings break
now by my george my garter and my crown
profaned dishonourd and the third usurpd
i swear
the george profaned hath lost his holy honour
the garter blemishd pawnd his knightly virtue
the crown usurpd disgraced his kingly glory
if something thou wilt swear to be believed
swear then by something that thou hast not wrongd
now by the world
tis full of thy foul wrongs
my fathers death
thy life hath that dishonourd
then by myself
thyself thyself misusest
why then by god
gods wrong is most of all
if thou hadst feard to break an oath by him
the unity the king thy brother made
if thou hadst feard to break an oath by him
the imperial metal circling now thy brow
had graced the tender temples of my child
and both the princes had been breathing here
which now two tender playfellows to dust
thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms
what canst thou swear by now
the time to come
that thou hast wronged in the time oerpast
for i myself have many tears to wash
hereafter time for time past wrongd by thee
the children live whose parents thou hast
slaughterd
ungovernd youth to wail it in their age
the parents live whose children thou hast butcherd
old witherd plants to wail it with their age
swear not by time to come for that thou hast
misused ere used by time misused oerpast
as i intend to prosper and repent
so thrive i in my dangerous attempt
of hostile arms myself myself confound
heaven and fortune bar me happy hours
day yield me not thy light nor night thy rest
be opposite all planets of good luck
to my proceedings if with pure hearts love
immaculate devotion holy thoughts
i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter
in her consists my happiness and thine
without her follows to this land and me
to thee herself and many a christian soul
it cannot be avoided but by this
it will not be avoided but by this
therefore good motheri must can you so
plead what i will be not what i have been
urge the necessity and state of times
and be not peevishfond in great designs
shall i be tempted of the devil thus
ay if the devil tempt thee to do good
shall i forget myself to be myself
ay if yourselfs remembrance wrong yourself
but thou didst kill my children
where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
selves of themselves to your recomforture
shall i go win my daughter to thy will
and be a happy mother by the deed
i go write to me very shortly
and you shall understand from me her mind
bear her my true loves kiss and so farewell
relenting fool and shallow changing woman
how now what news
my gracious sovereign on the western coast
rideth a puissant navy to the shore
throng many doubtful hollowhearted friends
tis thought that richmond is their admiral
and there they hull expecting but the aid
of buckingham to welcome them ashore

whiteliverd runagate what doth he there
i know not mighty sovereign but by guess
well sir as you guess as you guess
stirrd up by dorset buckingham and ely
he makes for england there to claim the crown
is the chair empty is the sword unswayd
is the king dead the empire unpossessd
what heir of york is there alive but we
and who is englands king but great yorks heir
then tell me what doth he upon the sea
unless for that my liege i cannot guess
unless for that he comes to be your liege
you cannot guess wherefore the welshman comes
thou wilt revolt and fly to him i fear
no mighty liege therefore mistrust me not
where is thy power then to beat him back
where are thy tenants and thy followers
are they not now upon the western shore
safeconducting the rebels from their ships
no my good lord my friends are in the north
when they should serve their sovereign in the west
please it your majesty to give me leave
ill muster up my friends and meet your grace
where and what time your majesty shall please
i will not trust you sir
most mighty sovereign
i never was nor never will be false
well
go muster men but hear you leave behind
or else his heads assurance is but frail
so deal with him as i prove true to you
my gracious sovereign now in devonshire
as i by friends am well advertised
sir edward courtney and the haughty prelate
bishop of exeter his brother there
with many more confederates are in arms
my liege in kent the guildfords are in arms
and every hour more competitors
flock to their aid and still their power increaseth
my lord the army of the duke of buckingham
out on you owls nothing but songs of death
take that until thou bring me better news
the news i have to tell your majesty
is that by sudden floods and fall of waters
buckinghams army is dispersed and scatterd
and he himself wanderd away alone
no man knows whither
there is my purse to cure that blow of thine
hath any welladvised friend proclaimd
reward to him that brings the traitor in
such proclamation hath been made my liege
sir thomas lovel and lord marquis dorset
tis said my liege in yorkshire are in arms
yet this good comfort bring i to your grace
richmond in yorkshire sent out a boat
unto the shore to ask those on the banks
if they were his assistants yea or no
who answerd him they came from buckingham
hoisted sail and made away for brittany
march on march on since we are up in arms
if not to fight with foreign enemies
yet to beat down these rebels here at home
my liege the duke of buckingham is taken
is with a mighty power landed at milford
is colder tidings yet they must be told
away towards salisbury while we reason here
a royal battle might be won and lost
some one take order buckingham be brought
to salisbury the rest march on with me
that in the sty of this most bloody boar
if i revolt off goes young georges head
the fear of that withholds my present aid
but tell me where is princely richmond now
at pembroke or at harfordwest in wales
what men of name resort to him
sir walter herbert a renowned soldier
sir gilbert talbot sir william stanley
oxford redoubted pembroke sir james blunt
and rice ap thomas with a valiant crew
and towards london they do bend their course
if by the way they be not fought withal
tell him the queen hath heartily consented
he shall espouse elizabeth her daughter
these letters will resolve him of my mind farewell
will not king richard let me speak with him
no my good lord therefore be patient
hastings and edwards children rivers grey
holy king henry and thy fair son edward
vaughan and all that have miscarried
by underhand corrupted foul injustice
if that your moody discontented souls
do through the clouds behold this present hour
even for revenge mock my destruction
this is allsouls day fellows is it not
it is my lord
why then allsouls day is my bodys doomsday
this is the day that in king edwards time
i wisht might fall on me when i was found
false to his children or his wifes allies
this is the day wherein i wishd to fall
by the false faith of him i trusted most
this this allsouls day to my fearful soul
that high allseer that i dallied with
hath turnd my feigned prayer on my head
and given in earnest what i beggd in jest
thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
now margarets curse is fallen upon my head
when he quoth she shall split thy heart with sorrow
remember margaret was a prophetess
come sirs convey me to the block of shame
wrong hath but wrong and blame the due of blame
fellows in arms and my most loving friends
bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny
thus far into the bowels of the land
have we marchd on without impediment
and here receive we from our father stanley
lines of fair comfort and encouragement
the wretched bloody and usurping boar
that spoild your summer fields and fruitful vines
swills your warm blood like wash and makes his trough
in your embowelld bosoms this foul swine
lies now even in the centre of this isle
near to the town of leicester as we learn
from tamworth thither is but one days march
in gods name cheerly on courageous friends
to reap the harvest of perpetual peace
by this one bloody trial of sharp war
every mans conscience is a thousand swords
to fight against that bloody homicide
i doubt not but his friends will fly to us
he hath no friends but who are friends for fear
which in his greatest need will shrink from him
kings it makes gods and meaner creatures kings
here pitch our tents even here in bosworth field
my lord of surrey why look you so sad
my heart is ten times lighter than my looks
my lord of norfolk
here most gracious liege
norfolk we must have knocks ha must we not
we must both give and take my gracious lord
up with my tent there here will i lie tonight
but where tomorrow  well alls one for that
who hath descried the number of the foe
six or seven thousand is their utmost power
besides the kings name is a tower of strength
which they upon the adverse party want
up with my tent there valiant gentlemen
let us survey the vantage of the field
call for some men of sound direction
lets want no discipline make no delay
for lords tomorrow is a busy day
the weary sun hath made a golden set
and by the bright track of his fiery car
gives signal of a goodly day tomorrow
sir william brandon you shall bear my standard
give me some ink and paper in my tent
ill draw the form and model of our battle
limit each leader to his several charge
and part in just proportion our small strength
my lord of oxford you sir william brandon
and you sir walter herbert stay with me
good captain blunt bear my good night to him
and by the second hour in the morning
yet one thing more good blunt before thou gost
where is lord stanley quarterd dost thou know
unless i have mistaen his colours much
which well i am assured i have not done
his regiment lies half a mile at least
south from the mighty power of the king
if without peril it be possible
good captain blunt bear my goodnight to him
and give him from me this most needful scroll
upon my life my lord ill undertake it
and so god give you quiet rest tonight
good night good captain blunt come gentlemen
let us consult upon tomorrows business
in to our tent the air is raw and cold
what ist oclock
its suppertime my lord
its nine oclock
i will not sup tonight
give me some ink and paper
what is my beaver easier than it was
and all my armour laid into my tent
if is my liege and all things are in readiness
good norfolk hie thee to thy charge
use careful watch choose trusty sentinels
i go my lord
stir with the lark tomorrow gentle norfolk
i warrant you my lord
catesby
my lord
send out a pursuivant at arms
to stanleys regiment bid him bring his power
before sunrising lest his son george fall
into the blind cave of eternal night
fill me a bowl of wine give me a watch
saddle white surrey for the field tomorrow
look that my staves be sound and not too heavy
ratcliff
my lord
sawst thou the melancholy lord northumberland
thomas the earl of surrey and himself
much about cockshut time from troop to troop
went through the army cheering up the soldiers
i have not that alacrity of spirit
nor cheer of mind that i was wont to have
set it down is ink and paper ready
it is my lord
bid my guard watch leave me
ratcliff about the mid of night come to my tent
and help to arm me leave me i say
fortune and victory sit on thy helm
all comfort that the dark night can afford
be to thy person noble fatherinlaw
tell me how fares our loving mother
i by attorney bless thee from thy mother
so much for that the silent hours steal on
and flaky darkness breaks within the east
in brieffor so the season bids us be
prepare thy battle early in the morning
and put thy fortune to the arbitrement
of bloody strokes and mortalstaring war
i as i maythat which i would i cannot
with best advantage will deceive the time
but on thy side i may not be too forward
lest being seen thy brother tender george
be executed in his fathers sight
cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
and ample interchange of sweet discourse
god give us leisure for these rites of love
ill strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap
lest leaden slumber peise me down tomorrow
once more good night kind lords and gentlemen
o thou whose captain i account myself
look on my forces with a gracious eye
put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath
that they may crush down with a heavy fall
the usurping helmets of our adversaries
make us thy ministers of chastisement
that we may praise thee in the victory
to thee i do commend my watchful soul
sleeping and waking o defend me still
have mercy jesusoft i did but dream
o coward conscience how dost thou afflict me
the lights burn blue it is now dead midnight
cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh
richard loves richard that is i am i
lest i revenge what myself upon myself
alack i love myself wherefore  for any good
that i myself have done unto myself
o no alas i rather hate myself
for hateful deeds committed by myself
my conscience hath a thousand several tongues
and every tongue brings in a several tale
and every tale condemns me for a villain
perjury perjury in the highst degree
murder stem murder in the direst degree
all several sins all used in each degree
throng to the bar crying all guilty guilty
i shall despair there is no creature loves me
nay wherefore should they since that i myself
find in myself no pity to myself
methought the souls of all that i had murderd
came to my tent and every one did threat
tomorrows vengeance on the head of richard
my lord
zounds who is there
ratcliff my lord tis i the early villagecock
hath twice done salutation to the morn
your friends are up and buckle on their armour
o ratcliff i have dreamd a fearful dream
what thinkest thou will our friends prove all true
no doubt my lord
o ratcliff i fear i fear
nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows
by the apostle paul shadows tonight
have struck more terror to the soul of richard
than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
armed in proof and led by shallow richmond
it is not yet near day come go with me
under our tents ill play the eavesdropper
to see if any mean to shrink from me
good morrow richmond
cry mercy lords and watchful gentlemen
that you have taen a tardy sluggard here
how have you slept my lord
the sweetest sleep and fairestboding dreams
that ever enterd in a drowsy head
have i since your departure had my lords
methought their souls whose bodies richard murderd
i promise you my soul is very jocund
in the remembrance of so fair a dream
how far into the morning is it lords
upon the stroke of four
why then tis time to arm and give direction
more than i have said loving countrymen
the leisure and enforcement of the time
god and our good cause fight upon our side
the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls
like highreard bulwarks stand before our faces
richard except those whom we fight against
for what is he they follow  truly gentlemen
a bloody tyrant and a homicide
one raised in blood and one in blood establishd
one that made means to come by what he hath
and slaughterd those that were the means to help him
abase foul stone made precious by the foil
of englands chair where he is falsely set
then if you fight against gods enemy
god will in justice ward you as his soldiers
if you do sweat to put a tyrant down
you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain
if you do fight against your countrys foes
your countrys fat shall pay your pains the hire
if you do fight in safeguard of your wives
your wives shall welcome home the conquerors
if you do free your children from the sword
your childrens children quit it in your age
then in the name of god and all these rights
advance your standards draw your willing swords
for me the ransom of my bold attempt
shall be this cold corpse on the earths cold face
but if i thrive the gain of my attempt
the least of you shall share his part thereof
sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully
god and saint george richmond and victory
what said northumberland as touching richmond
that he was never trained up in arms
he smiled and said the better for our purpose
he was in the right and so indeed it is
ten the clock there give me a calendar
who saw the sun today
not i my lord
then he disdains to shine for by the book
he should have braved the east an hour ago
a black day will it be to somebody ratcliff
my lord
the sun will not be seen today
the sky doth frown and lour upon our army
i would these dewy tears were from the ground
not shine today why what is that to me
more than to richmond  for the selfsame heaven
that frowns on me looks sadly upon him
arm arm my lord the foe vaunts in the field
come bustle bustle caparison my horse
i will lead forth my soldiers to the plain
my foreward shall be drawn out all in length
consisting equally of horse and foot
our archers shall be placed in the midst
john duke of norfolk thomas earl of surrey
shall have the leading of this foot and horse
they thus directed we will follow
in the main battle whose puissance on either side
shall be well winged with our chiefest horse
this and saint george to boot what thinkst thou norfolk
a good direction warlike sovereign
this found i on my tent this morning
my lord he doth deny to come
off with his son georges head
my lord the enemy is past the marsh
after the battle let george stanley die
advance our standards set upon our foes
our ancient word of courage fair saint george
inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons
upon them victory sits on our helms
rescue my lord of norfolk rescue rescue
the king enacts more wonders than a man
his horse is slain and all on foot he fights
seeking for richmond in the throat of death
rescue fair lord or else the day is lost
a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
withdraw my lord ill help you to a horse
slave i have set my life upon a cast
i think there be six richmonds in the field
five have i slain today instead of him
a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
god and your arms be praised victorious friends
the day is ours the bloody dog is dead
courageous richmond well hast thou acquit thee
lo here this longusurped royalty
from the dead temples of this bloody wretch
wear it enjoy it and make much of it
great god of heaven say amen to all
but tell me is young george stanley living
he is my lord and safe in leicester town
whither if it please you we may now withdraw us
what men of name are slain on either side
john duke of norfolk walter lord ferrers
sir robert brakenbury and sir william brandon
proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
and then as we have taen the sacrament
smile heaven upon this fair conjunction
that long have frownd upon their enmity
what traitor hears me and says not amen
england hath long been mad and scarrd herself
the brother blindly shed the brothers blood
the father rashly slaughterd his own son
all this divided york and lancaster
divided in their dire division
o now let richmond and elizabeth
the true succeeders of each royal house
by gods fair ordinance conjoin together
and let their heirs god if thy will be so
enrich the time to come with smoothfaced peace
with smiling plenty and fair prosperous days
abate the edge of traitors gracious lord
that would reduce these bloody days again
and make poor england weep in streams of blood
let them not live to taste this lands increase
that would with treason wound this fair lands peace
that she may long live here god say amen
old john of gaunt timehonourd lancaster
hast thou according to thy oath and band
brought hither henry hereford thy bold son
here to make good the boisterous late appeal
which then our leisure would not let us hear
against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
i have my liege
tell me moreover hast thou sounded him
if he appeal the duke on ancient malice
or worthily as a good subject should
on some known ground of treachery in him
as near as i could sift him on that argument
on some apparent danger seen in him
aimd at your highness no inveterate malice
then call them to our presence face to face
and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear
highstomachd are they both and full of ire
in rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire
many years of happy days befal
my gracious sovereign my most loving liege
each day still better others happiness
until the heavens envying earths good hap
add an immortal title to your crown
as well appeareth by the cause you come
namely to appeal each other of high treason
cousin of hereford what dost thou object
against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
first heaven be the record to my speech
in the devotion of a subjects love
tendering the precious safety of my prince
and free from other misbegotten hate
come i appellant to this princely presence
now thomas mowbray do i turn to thee
and mark my greeting well for what i speak
my body shall make good upon this earth
or my divine soul answer it in heaven
thou art a traitor and a miscreant
too good to be so and too bad to live
since the more fair and crystal is the sky
the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly
once more the more to aggravate the note
with a foul traitors name stuff i thy throat
and wish so please my sovereign ere i move
what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove
tis not the trial of a womans war
the bitter clamour of two eager tongues
can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain
yet can i not of such tame patience boast
first the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
from giving reins and spurs to my free speech
which else would post until it had returnd
these terms of treason doubled down his throat
setting aside his high bloods royalty
and let him be no kinsman to my liege
i do defy him and i spit at him
which to maintain i would allow him odds
and meet him were i tied to run afoot
even to the frozen ridges of the alps
or any other ground inhabitable
where ever englishman durst set his foot
mean time let this defend my loyalty
by all my hopes most falsely doth he lie
pale trembling coward there i throw my gage
disclaiming here the kindred of the king
and lay aside my high bloods royalty
which fear not reverence makes thee to except
if guilty dread have left thee so much strength
by that and all the rites of knighthood else
will i make good against thee arm to arm
what i have spoke or thou canst worse devise
i take it up and by that sword i swear
which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder
ill answer thee in any fair degree
and when i mount alive may i not light
if i be traitor or unjustly fight
what doth our cousin lay to mowbrays charge
it must be great that can inherit us
so much as of a thought of ill in him
look what i speak my life shall prove it true
that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
in name of lendings for your highness soldiers
the which he hath detaind for lewd employments
like a false traitor and injurious villain
besides i say and will in battle prove
or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
that ever was surveyd by english eye
that all the treasons for these eighteen years
complotted and contrived in this land
fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring
further i say and further will maintain
upon his bad life to make all this good
that he did plot the duke of gloucesters death
suggest his soonbelieving adversaries
and consequently like a traitor coward
which blood like sacrificing abels cries
even from the tongueless caverns of the earth
to me for justice and rough chastisement
and by the glorious worth of my descent
this arm shall do it or this life be spent
how high a pitch his resolution soars
thomas of norfolk what sayst thou to this
o let my sovereign turn away his face
and bid his ears a little while be deaf
till i have told this slander of his blood
how god and good men hate so foul a liar
were he my brother nay my kingdoms heir
as he is but my fathers brothers son
now by my sceptres awe i make a vow
such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
should nothing privilege him nor partialize
free speech and fearless i to thee allow
then bolingbroke as low as to thy heart
through the false passage of thy throat thou liest
three parts of that receipt i had for calais
disbursed i duly to his highness soldiers
the other part reserved i by consent
for that my sovereign liege was in my debt
upon remainder of a dear account
now swallow down that lie for gloucesters death
i slew him not but to my own disgrace
neglected my sworn duty in that case
for you my noble lord of lancaster
the honourable father to my foe
once did i lay an ambush for your life
a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
but ere i last received the sacrament
i did confess it and exactly beggd
your graces pardon and i hope i had it
it issues from the rancour of a villain
a recreant and most degenerate traitor
which in myself i boldly will defend
and interchangeably hurl down my gage
upon this overweening traitors foot
to prove myself a loyal gentleman
even in the best blood chamberd in his bosom
in haste whereof most heartily i pray
your highness to assign our trial day
wrathkindled gentlemen be ruled by me
this we prescribe though no physician
deep malice makes too deep incision
forget forgive conclude and be agreed
our doctors say this is no month to bleed
good uncle let this end where it begun
well calm the duke of norfolk you your son
throw down my son the duke of norfolks gage
and norfolk throw down his
when harry when
obedience bids i should not bid again
norfolk throw down we bid there is no boot
myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot
the one my duty owes but my fair name
despite of death that lives upon my grave
to dark dishonours use thou shalt not have
i am disgraced impeachd and baffled here
pierced to the soul with slanders venomd spear
the which no balm can cure but his heartblood
which breathed this poison
and i resign my gage my dear dear lord
the purest treasure mortal times afford
men are but gilded loam or painted clay
a jewel in a tentimesbarrdup chest
is a bold spirit in a loyal breast
then dear my liege mine honour let me try
in that i live and for that will i die
cousin throw up your gage do you begin
o god defend my soul from such deep sin
shall i seem crestfalln in my fathers sight
or with pale beggarfear impeach my height
before this outdared dastard ere my tongue
shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong
or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear
the slavish motive of recanting fear
and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace
where shame doth harbour even in mowbrays face
we were not born to sue but to command
which since we cannot do to make you friends
be ready as your lives shall answer it
there shall your swords and lances arbitrate
since we can not atone you we shall see
justice design the victors chivalry
lord marshal command our officers at arms
be ready to direct these home alarms
alas the part i had in woodstocks blood
doth more solicit me than your exclaims
to stir against the butchers of his life
but since correction lieth in those hands
which made the fault that we cannot correct
put we our quarrel to the will of heaven
who when they see the hours ripe on earth
will rain hot vengeance on offenders heads
finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur
hath love in thy old blood no living fire
edwards seven sons whereof thyself art one
were as seven vials of his sacred blood
some of those seven are dried by natures course
some of those branches by the destinies cut
but thomas my dear lord my life my gloucester
one vial full of edwards sacred blood
one flourishing branch of his most royal root
is crackd and all the precious liquor spilt
is hackd down and his summer leaves all faded
by envys hand and murders bloody axe
ah gaunt his blood was thine that bed that womb
that metal that selfmould that fashiond thee
made him a man and though thou livest and breathest
in some large measure to thy fathers death
in that thou seest thy wretched brother die
who was the model of thy fathers life
in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughterd
thou showest the naked pathway to thy life
that which in mean men we intitle patience
is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts
what shall i say to safeguard thine own life
the best way is to venge my gloucesters death
gods is the quarrel for gods substitute
his deputy anointed in his sight
let heaven revenge for i may never lift
an angry arm against his minister
where then alas may i complain myself
to god the widows champion and defence
why then i will farewell old gaunt
thou goest to coventry there to behold
o sit my husbands wrongs on herefords spear
that it may enter butcher mowbrays breast
or if misfortune miss the first career
be mowbrays sins so heavy in his bosom
they may break his foaming coursers back
and throw the rider headlong in the lists
a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford
with her companion grief must end her life
as much good stay with thee as go with me
i take my leave before i have begun
for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done
commend me to thy brother edmund york
though this be all do not so quickly go
i shall remember more bid himah what
with all good speed at plashy visit me
alack and what shall good old york there see
but empty lodgings and unfurnishd walls
unpeopled offices untrodden stones
and what hear there for welcome but my groans
therefore commend me let him not come there
to seek out sorrow that dwells every where
the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye
my lord aumerle is harry hereford armd
yea at all points and longs to enter in
the duke of norfolk sprightfully and bold
stays but the summons of the appellants trumpet
why then the champions are prepared and stay
for nothing but his majestys approach
marshal demand of yonder champion
ask him his name and orderly proceed
to swear him in the justice of his cause
in gods name and the kings say who thou art
and why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms
speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath
as so defend thee heaven and thy valour
my name is thomas mowbray duke of norfolk
who hither come engaged by my oath
which god defend a knight should violate
both to defend my loyalty and truth
to god my king and my succeeding issue
against the duke of hereford that appeals me
and by the grace of god and this mine arm
to prove him in defending of myself
and as i truly fight defend me heaven
marshal ask yonder knight in arms
both who he is and why he cometh hither
thus plated in habiliments of war
and formally according to our law
depose him in the justice of his cause
what is thy name and wherefore comest thou hither
before king richard in his royal lists
against whom comest thou and whats thy quarrel
speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven
harry of hereford lancaster and derby
am i who ready here do stand in arms
to prove by gods grace and my bodys valour
in lists on thomas mowbray duke of norfolk
that he is a traitor foul and dangerous
to god of heaven king richard and to me
and as i truly fight defend me heaven
on pain of death no person be so bold
or daringhardy as to touch the lists
except the marshal and such officers
appointed to direct these fair designs
lord marshal let me kiss my sovereigns hand
for mowbray and myself are like two men
that vow a long and weary pilgrimage
then let us take a ceremonious leave
and loving farewell of our several friends
the appellant in all duty greets your highness
and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave
we will descend and fold him in our arms
cousin of hereford as thy cause is right
so be thy fortune in this royal fight
farewell my blood which if today thou shed
lament we may but not revenge thee dead
o let no noble eye profane a tear
as confident as is the falcons flight
against a bird do i with mowbray fight
my loving lord i take my leave of you
of you my noble cousin lord aumerle
not sick although i have to do with death
but lusty young and cheerly drawing breath
lo as at english feasts so i regreet
o thou the earthly author of my blood
whose youthful spirit in me regenerate
doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
to reach at victory above my head
add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers
and with thy blessings steel my lances point
that it may enter mowbrays waxen coat
and furbish new the name of john a gaunt
even in the lusty havior of his son
god in thy good cause make thee prosperous
be swift like lightning in the execution
and let thy blows doubly redoubled
fall like amazing thunder on the casque
rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live
mine innocency and saint george to thrive
however god or fortune cast my lot
there lives or dies true to king richards throne
never did captive with a freer heart
cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
his golden uncontrolld enfranchisement
more than my dancing soul doth celebrate
this feast of battle with mine adversary
most mighty liege and my companion peers
as gentle and as jocund as to jest
virtue with valour couched in thine eye
order the trial marshal and begin
harry of hereford lancaster and derby
receive thy lance and god defend the right
strong as a tower in hope i cry amen
go bear this lance to thomas duke of norfolk
harry of hereford lancaster and derby
stands here for god his sovereign and himself
on pain to be found false and recreant
to prove the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray
a traitor to his god his king and him
and dares him to set forward to the fight
here standeth thomas mowbray duke of norfolk
on pain to be found false and recreant
both to defend himself and to approve
henry of hereford lancaster and derby
to god his sovereign and to him disloyal
courageously and with a free desire
attending but the signal to begin
sound trumpets and set forward combatants
stay the king hath thrown his warder down
let them lay by their helmets and their spears
while we return these dukes what we decree
draw near
and list what with our council we have done
for that our kingdoms earth should not be soild
with that dear blood which it hath fostered
and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
of civil wounds ploughd up with neighbours sword
and for we think the eaglewinged pride
of skyaspiring and ambitious thoughts
with rivalhating envy set on you
to wake our peace which in our countrys cradle
draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep
which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums
with harsh resounding trumpets dreadful bray
and grating shock of wrathful iron arms
might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
and make us wade even in our kindreds blood
you cousin hereford upon pain of life
till twice five summers have enrichd our fields
shall not regreet our fair dominions
but tread the stranger paths of banishment
sun that warms you here shall shine on me
and those his golden beams to you here lent
shall point on me and gild my banishment
norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom
the sly slow hours shall not determinate
the dateless limit of thy dear exile
the hopeless word of never to return
breathe i against thee upon pain of life
a heavy sentence my most sovereign liege
a dearer merit not so deep a maim
as to be cast forth in the common air
have i deserved at your highness hands
the language i have learnd these forty years
and now my tongues use is to me no more
than an unstringed viol or a harp
or like a cunning instrument cased up
or being open put into his hands
within my mouth you have engaold my tongue
doubly portcullisd with my teeth and lips
and dull unfeeling barren ignorance
is made my gaoler to attend on me
i am too old to fawn upon a nurse
what is thy sentence then but speechless death
which robs my tongue from breathing native breath
after our sentence plaining comes too late
then thus i turn me from my countrys light
to dwell in solemn shades of endless night
return again and take an oath with thee
lay on our royal sword your banishd hands
swear by the duty that you owe to god
our part therein we banish with yourselves
you never shall so help you truth and god
embrace each others love in banishment
nor never look upon each others face
nor never write regreet nor reconcile
this louring tempest of your homebred hate
nor never by advised purpose meet
to plot contrive or complot any ill
gainst us our state our subjects or our land
i swear
and i to keep all this
by this time had the king permitted us
one of our souls had wanderd in the air
banishd this frail sepulchre of our flesh
confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm
since thou hast far to go bear not along
the clogging burthen of a guilty soul
my name be blotted from the book of life
and i from heaven banishd as from hence
but what thou art god thou and i do know
and all too soon i fear the king shall rue
farewell my liege now no way can i stray
save back to england all the worlds my way
uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes
hath from the number of his banishd years
pluckd four away
six frozen winter spent
return with welcome home from banishment
how long a time lies in one little word
four lagging winters and four wanton springs
i thank my liege that in regard of me
but little vantage shall i reap thereby
for ere the six years that he hath to spend
can change their moons and bring their times about
my oildried lamp and timebewasted light
shall be extinct with age and endless night
my inch of taper will be burnt and done
and blindfold death not let me see my son
why uncle thou hast many years to live
shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow
and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow
thou canst help time to furrow me with age
but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage
thy word is current with him for my death
but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath
thy son is banishd upon good advice
why at our justice seemst thou then to lour
things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour
you urged me as a judge but i had rather
you would have bid me argue like a father
o had it been a stranger not my child
a partial slander sought i to avoid
and in the sentence my own life destroyd
alas i lookd when some of you should say
i was too strict to make mine own away
but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
against my will to do myself this wrong
six years we banish him and he shall go
from where you do remain let paper show
my lord no leave take i for i will ride
as far as land will let me by your side
o to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words
that thou returnst no greeting to thy friends
i have too few to take my leave of you
when the tongues office should be prodigal
to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart
thy grief is but thy absence for a time
joy absent grief is present for that time
what is six winters they are quickly gone
to men in joy but grief makes one hour ten
call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure
my heart will sigh when i miscall it so
which finds it an inforced pilgrimage
the sullen passage of thy weary steps
esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
the precious jewel of thy home return
nay rather every tedious stride i make
will but remember me what a deal of world
i wander from the jewels that i love
must i not serve a long apprenticehood
to foreign passages and in the end
having my freedom boast of nothing else
but that i was a journeyman to grief
all places that the eye of heaven visits
are to a wise man ports and happy havens
teach thy necessity to reason thus
there is no virtue like necessity
think not the king did banish thee
but thou the king woe doth the heavier sit
where it perceives it is but faintly borne
go say i sent thee forth to purchase honour
and not the king exiled thee or suppose
devouring pestilence hangs in our air
look what thy soul holds dear imagine it
suppose the singing birds musicians
the grass whereon thou treadst the presence strewd
the flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more
than a delightful measure or a dance
for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
the man that mocks at it and sets it light
o who can hold a fire in his hand
by thinking on the frosty caucasus
or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
by bare imagination of a feast
or wallow naked in december snow
by thinking on fantastic summers heat
o no the apprehension of the good
fell sorrows tooth doth never rankle more
than when he bites but lanceth not the sore
had i thy youth and cause i would not stay
then englands ground farewell sweet soil adieu
my mother and my nurse that bears me yet
whereer i wander boast of this i can
though banishd yet a trueborn englishman
we did observe cousin aumerle
how far brought you high hereford on his way
i brought high hereford if you call him so
but to the next highway and there i left him
and say what store of parting tears were shed
faith none for me except the northeast wind
which then blew bitterly against our faces
awaked the sleeping rheum and so by chance
did grace our hollow parting with a tear
what said our cousin when you parted with him
and for my heart disdained that my tongue
should so profane the word that taught me craft
to counterfeit oppression of such grief
that words seemd buried in my sorrows grave
marry would the word farewell have lengthend hours
and added years to his short banishment
he should have had a volume of farewells
but since it would not he had none of me
he is our cousin cousin but tis doubt
when time shall call him home from banishment
whether our kinsman come to see his friends
ourself and bushy bagot here and green
observed his courtship to the common people
how he did seem to dive into their hearts
with humble and familiar courtesy
what reverence he did throw away on slaves
wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
and patient underbearing of his fortune
as twere to banish their affects with him
off goes his bonnet to an oysterwench
a brace of draymen bid god speed him well
and had the tribute of his supple knee
with thanks my countrymen my loving friends
as were our england in reversion his
and he our subjects next degree in hope
well he is gone and with him go these thoughts
now for the rebels which stand out in ireland
expedient manage must be made my liege
ere further leisure yield them further means
for their advantage and your highness loss
and for our coffers with too great a court
and liberal largess are grown somewhat light
we are inforced to farm our royal realm
the revenue whereof shall furnish us
our substitutes at home shall have blank charters
whereto when they shall know what men are rich
they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
and send them after to supply our wants
for we will make for ireland presently
bushy what news
old john of gaunt is grievous sick my lord
suddenly taken and hath sent post haste
to entreat your majesty to visit him
where lies he
at ely house
now put it god in the physicians mind
to help him to his grave immediately
the lining of his coffers shall make coats
to deck our soldiers for these irish wars
pray god we may make haste and come too late
amen
will the king come that i may breathe my last
in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth
vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath
for all in vain comes counsel to his ear
o but they say the tongues of dying men
where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain
for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain
he that no more must say is listend more
than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose
the setting sun and music at the close
as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last
though richard my lifes counsel would not hear
my deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear
no it is stoppd with other flattering sounds
as praises of whose taste the wise are fond
lascivious metres to whose venom sound
the open ear of youth doth always listen
report of fashions in proud italy
whose manners still our tardy apish nation
limps after in base imitation
where doth the world thrust forth a vanity
so it be new theres no respect how vile
that is not quickly buzzed into his ears
then all too late comes counsel to be heard
where will doth mutiny with wits regard
tis breath thou lackst and that breath wilt thou lose
methinks i am a prophet new inspired
his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
for violent fires soon burn out themselves
small showers last long but sudden storms are short
he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes
light vanity insatiate cormorant
consuming means soon preys upon itself
this royal throne of kings this scepterd isle
this earth of majesty this seat of mars
this other eden demiparadise
this fortress built by nature for herself
against infection and the hand of war
this happy breed of men this little world
this precious stone set in the silver sea
which serves it in the office of a wall
or as a moat defensive to a house
against the envy of less happier lands
this blessed plot this earth this realm this england
this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings
feard by their breed and famous by their birth
renowned for their deeds as far from home
for christian service and true chivalry
as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry
of the worlds ransom blessed marys son
this land of such dear souls this dear dear land
dear for her reputation through the world
is now leased out i die pronouncing it
england bound in with the triumphant sea
whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
of watery neptune is now bound in with shame
that england that was wont to conquer others
hath made a shameful conquest of itself
ah would the scandal vanish with my life
how happy then were my ensuing death
for young hot colts being raged do rage the more
how fares our noble uncle lancaster
what comfort man how ist with aged gaunt
o how that name befits my composition
within me grief hath kept a tedious fast
and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt
for sleeping england long time have i watchd
the pleasure that some fathers feed upon
is my strict fast i mean my childrens looks
gaunt am i for the grave gaunt as a grave
whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones
can sick men play so nicely with their names
since thou dost seek to kill my name in me
i mock my name great king to flatter thee
should dying men flatter with those that live
no no men living flatter those that die
thou now adying sayst thou flatterest me
o no thou diest though i the sicker be
i am in health i breathe and see thee ill
now he that made me knows i see thee ill
ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill
thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land
wherein thou liest in reputation sick
and thou too careless patient as thou art
commitst thy anointed body to the cure
a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown
whose compass is no bigger than thy head
and yet incaged in so small a verge
the waste is no whit lesser than thy land
o had thy grandsire with a prophets eye
seen how his sons son should destroy his sons
from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame
deposing thee before thou wert possessd
which art possessd now to depose thyself
why cousin wert thou regent of the world
it were a shame to let this land by lease
but for thy world enjoying but this land
is it not more than shame to shame it so
thy state of law is bondslave to the law and thou
a lunatic leanwitted fool
presuming on an agues privilege
darest with thy frozen admonition
make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood
with fury from his native residence
now by my seats right royal majesty
wert thou not brother to great edwards son
this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders
o spare me not my brother edwards son
for that i was his father edwards son
that blood already like the pelican
my brother gloucester plain wellmeaning soul
whom fair befal in heaven mongst happy souls
may be a precedent and witness good
join with the present sickness that i have
and thy unkindness be like crooked age
to crop at once a too long witherd flower
live in thy shame but die not shame with thee
these words hereafter thy tormentors be
love they to live that love and honour have
and let them die that age and sullens have
for both hast thou and both become the grave
i do beseech your majesty impute his words
he loves you on my life and holds you dear
as harry duke of hereford were he here
as theirs so mine and all be as it is
my liege old gaunt commends him to your majesty
what says he
nay nothing all is said
his tongue is now a stringless instrument
words life and all old lancaster hath spent
be york the next that must be bankrupt so
though death be poor it ends a mortal woe
the ripest fruit first falls and so doth he
his time is spent our pilgrimage must be
we must supplant those rough rugheaded kerns
which live like venom where no venom else
but only they have privilege to live
and for these great affairs do ask some charge
towards our assistance we do seize to us
the plate corn revenues and moveables
whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possessd
how long shall i be patient ah how long
shall tender duty make me suffer wrong
not gloucesters death nor herefords banishment
not gaunts rebukes nor englands private wrongs
nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke
about his marriage nor my own disgrace
have ever made me sour my patient cheek
or bend one wrinkle on my sovereigns face
i am the last of noble edwards sons
in war was never lion raged more fierce
in peace was never gentle lamb more mild
than was that young and princely gentleman
his face thou hast for even so lookd he
accomplishd with the number of thy hours
but when he frownd it was against the french
and not against his friends his noble hand
did will what he did spend and spent not that
which his triumphant fathers hand had won
his hands were guilty of no kindred blood
but bloody with the enemies of his kin
o richard york is too far gone with grief
or else he never would compare between
why uncle whats the matter
o my liege
pardon me if you please if not i pleased
not to be pardond am content withal
seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
the royalties and rights of banishd hereford
is not gaunt dead and doth not hereford live
was not gaunt just and is not harry true
did not the one deserve to have an heir
is not his heir a welldeserving son
take herefords rights away and take from time
his charters and his customary rights
let not tomorrow then ensue today
be not thyself for how art thou a king
but by fair sequence and succession
now afore godgod forbid i say true
if you do wrongfully seize herefords rights
call in the letters patent that he hath
by his attorneysgeneral to sue
his livery and deny his offerd homage
you pluck a thousand dangers on your head
you lose a thousand welldisposed hearts
and prick my tender patience to those thoughts
which honour and allegiance cannot think
think what you will we seize into our hands
his plate his goods his money and his lands
what will ensue hereof theres none can tell
but by bad courses may be understood
that their events can never fall out good
bid him repair to us to ely house
to see this business tomorrow next
and we create in absence of ourself
our uncle york lord governor of england
for he is just and always loved us well
be merry for our time of stay is short
well lords the duke of lancaster is dead
and living too for now his son is duke
barely in title not in revenue
richly in both if justice had her right
my heart is great but it must break with silence
eret be disburdend with a liberal tongue
nay speak thy mind and let him neer speak more
that speaks thy words again to do thee harm
tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford
if it be so out with it boldly man
quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him
no good at all that i can do for him
unless you call it good to pity him
bereft and gelded of his patrimony
now afore god tis shame such wrongs are borne
in him a royal prince and many moe
of noble blood in this declining land
the king is not himself but basely led
by flatterers and what they will inform
merely in hate gainst any of us all
that will the king severely prosecute
gainst us our lives our children and our heirs
the commons hath he pilld with grievous taxes
for ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts
and daily new exactions are devised
but what o gods name doth become of this
wars have not wasted it for warrd he hath not
but basely yielded upon compromise
more hath he spent in peace than they in wars
the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm
the kings grown bankrupt like a broken man
reproach and dissolution hangeth over him
he hath not money for these irish wars
his burthenous taxations notwithstanding
but by the robbing of the banishd duke
but lords we hear this fearful tempest sing
yet see no shelter to avoid the storm
we see the wind sit sore upon our sails
and yet we strike not but securely perish
we see the very wreck that we must suffer
and unavoided is the danger now
for suffering so the causes of our wreck
not so even through the hollow eyes of death
i spy life peering but i dare not say
how near the tidings of our comfort is
nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours
we three are but thyself and speaking so
thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold
in brittany received intelligence
that harry duke of hereford rainold lord cobham
that late broke from the duke of exeter
his brother archbishop late of canterbury
sir thomas erpingham sir john ramston
sir john norbery sir robert waterton and francis quoint
all these well furnishd by the duke of bretagne
with eight tall ships three thousand men of war
are making hither with all due expedience
perhaps they had ere this but that they stay
the first departing of the king for ireland
if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke
imp out our drooping countrys broken wing
redeem from broking pawn the blemishd crown
wipe off the dust that hides our sceptres gilt
and make high majesty look like itself
away with me in post to ravenspurgh
but if you faint as fearing to do so
stay and be secret and myself will go
to horse to horse urge doubts to them that fear
hold out my horse and i will first be there
you promised when you parted with the king
to lay aside lifeharming heaviness
and entertain a cheerful disposition
to please the king i did to please myself
i cannot do it yet i know no cause
why i should welcome such a guest as grief
save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
some unborn sorrow ripe in fortunes womb
is coming towards me and my inward soul
more than with parting from my lord the king
each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows
which shows like grief itself but is not so
for sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears
divides one thing entire to many objects
like perspectives which rightly gazed upon
show nothing but confusion eyed awry
looking awry upon your lords departure
find shapes of grief more than himself to wail
which lookd on as it is is nought but shadows
of what it is not then thricegracious queen
or if it be tis with false sorrows eye
which for things true weeps things imaginary
it may be so but yet my inward soul
i cannot but be sad so heavy sad
as though on thinking on no thought i think
makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink
tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady
from some forefather grief mine is not so
for nothing had begot my something grief
tis in reversion that i do possess
but what it is that is not yet known what
i cannot name tis nameless woe i wot
i hope the king is not yet shippd for ireland
why hopest thou so tis better hope he is
then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shippd
that he our hope might have retired his power
and driven into despair an enemys hope
the banishd bolingbroke repeals himself
and with uplifted arms is safe arrived
at ravenspurgh
now god in heaven forbid
the lord northumberland his son young henry percy
the lords of ross beaumond and willoughby
with all their powerful friends are fled to him
why have you not proclaimd northumberland
and all the rest revolted faction traitors
hath broke his staff resignd his stewardship
and all the household servants fled with him
to bolingbroke
so green thou art the midwife to my woe
now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy
and i a gasping newdeliverd mother
have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow joind
despair not madam
who shall hinder me
i will despair and be at enmity
a parasite a keeper back of death
who gently would dissolve the bands of life
which false hope lingers in extremity
here comes the duke of york
o full of careful business are his looks
uncle for gods sake speak comfortable words
comforts in heaven and we are on the earth
where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief
your husband he is gone to save far off
here am i left to underprop his land
now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made
now shall he try his friends that flatterd him
my lord your son was gone before i came
he was why so go all which way it will
the nobles they are fled the commons they are cold
and will i fear revolt on herefords side
sirrah get thee to plashy to my sister gloucester
hold take my ring
my lord i had forgot to tell your lordship
today as i came by i called there
but i shall grieve you to report the rest
what ist knave
an hour before i came the duchess died
god for his mercy what a tide of woes
comes rushing on this woeful land at once
so my untruth had not provoked him to it
the king had cut off my head with my brothers
what are there no posts dispatchd for ireland
how shall we do for money for these wars
come sistercousin i would saypray pardon me
go fellow get thee home provide some carts
and bring away the armour that is there
gentlemen will you go muster men
if i know how or which way to order these affairs
thus thrust disorderly into my hands
the one is my sovereign whom both my oath
and duty bids defend the other again
is my kinsman whom the king hath wrongd
whom conscience and my kindred bids to right
well somewhat we must do come cousin ill
dispose of you
gentlemen go muster up your men
and meet me presently at berkeley
i should to plashy too
and every thing is left at six and seven
the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland
but none returns for us to levy power
proportionable to the enemy
is all unpossible
besides our nearness to the king in love
is near the hate of those love not the king
lies in their purses and whoso empties them
by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate
wherein the king stands generally condemnd
if judgement lie in them then so do we
because we ever have been near the king
the earl of wiltshire is already there
thither will i with you for little office
the hateful commons will perform for us
except like curs to tear us all to pieces
will you go along with us
no i will to ireland to his majesty
we three here art that neer shall meet again
thats as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke
alas poor duke the task he undertakes
where one on his side fights thousands will fly
farewell at once for once for all and ever
well we may meet again
i fear me never
how far is it my lord to berkeley now
believe me noble lord
these high wild hills and rough uneven ways
draws out our miles and makes them wearisome
and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar
making the hard way sweet and delectable
but i bethink me what a weary way
from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found
in ross and willoughby wanting your company
which i protest hath very much beguiled
but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
the present benefit which i possess
and hope to joy is little less in joy
shall make their way seem short as mine hath done
by sight of what i have your noble company
of much less value is my company
than your good words but who comes here
it is my son young harry percy
sent from my brother worcester whencesoever
harry how fares your uncle
i had thought my lord to have learnd his health of you
why is he not with the queen
no my good lord he hath forsook the court
broken his staff of office and dispersed
the household of the king
what was his reason
he was not so resolved when last we spake together
because your lordship was proclaimed traitor
but he my lord is gone to ravenspurgh
to offer service to the duke of hereford
and sent me over by berkeley to discover
what power the duke of york had levied there
then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh
have you forgot the duke of hereford boy
no my good lord for that is not forgot
i never in my life did look on him
then learn to know him now this is the duke
my gracious lord i tender you my service
which elder days shall ripen and confirm
to more approved service and desert
i thank thee gentle percy and be sure
i count myself in nothing else so happy
as in a soul remembering my good friends
and as my fortune ripens with thy love
my heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it
how far is it to berkeley and what stir
keeps good old york there with his men of war
there stands the castle by yon tuft of trees
mannd with three hundred men as i have heard
and in it are the lords of york berkeley and seymour
none else of name and noble estimate
here come the lords of ross and willoughby
bloody with spurring fieryred with haste
welcome my lords i wot your love pursues
is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrichd
shall be your love and labours recompense
your presence makes us rich most noble lord
and far surmounts our labour to attain it
evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor
which till my infant fortune comes to years
stands for my bounty but who comes here
it is my lord of berkeley as i guess
my lord of hereford my message is to you
my lord my answer isto lancaster
and i am come to seek that name in england
and i must find that title in your tongue
before i make reply to aught you say
mistake me not my lord tis not my meaning
to you my lord i come what lord you will
from the most gracious regent of this land
the duke of york to know what pricks you on
to take advantage of the absent time
and fright our native peace with selfborn arms
i shall not need transport my words by you
here comes his grace in person my noble uncle
show me thy humble heart and not thy knee
whose duty is deceiveable and false
my gracious uncle
tut tut
i am no traitors uncle and that word grace
in an ungracious mouth is but profane
why have those banishd and forbidden legs
dared once to touch a dust of englands ground
but then more why why have they dared to march
so many miles upon her peaceful bosom
frighting her palefaced villages with war
and ostentation of despised arms
comest thou because the anointed king is hence
why foolish boy the king is left behind
and in my loyal bosom lies his power
were i but now the lord of such hot youth
as when brave gaunt thy father and myself
rescued the black prince that young mars of men
from forth the ranks of many thousand french
o then how quickly should this arm of mine
now prisoner to the palsy chastise thee
and minister correction to thy fault
on what condition stands it and wherein
even in condition of the worst degree
thou art a banishd man and here art come
before the expiration of thy time
in braving arms against thy sovereign
as i was banishd i was banishd hereford
but as i come i come for lancaster
and noble uncle i beseech your grace
you are my father for methinks in you
i see old gaunt alive o then my father
will you permit that i shall stand condemnd
a wandering vagabond my rights and royalties
pluckd from my arms perforce and given away
to upstart unthrifts wherefore was i born
if that my cousin king be king of england
it must be granted i am duke of lancaster
you have a son aumerle my noble cousin
had you first died and he been thus trod down
he should have found his uncle gaunt a father
to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay
i am denied to sue my livery here
my fathers goods are all distraind and sold
and these and all are all amiss employd
what would you have me do i am a subject
and therefore personally i lay my claim
to my inheritance of free descent
the noble duke hath been too much abused
it stands your grace upon to do him right
base men by his endowments are made great
i have had feeling of my cousins wrongs
and laboured all i could to do him right
but in this kind to come in braving arms
be his own carver and cut out his way
to find out right with wrong it may not be
and you that do abet him in this kind
cherish rebellion and are rebels all
the noble duke hath sworn his coming is
but for his own and for the right of that
we all have strongly sworn to give him aid
and let him neer see joy that breaks that oath
i cannot mend it i must needs confess
but if i could by him that gave me life
i would attach you all and make you stoop
unto the sovereign mercy of the king
but since i cannot be it known to you
i do remain as neuter so fare you well
unless you please to enter in the castle
and there repose you for this night
but we must win your grace to go with us
to bristol castle which they say is held
by bushy bagot and their complices
the caterpillars of the commonwealth
which i have sworn to weed and pluck away
for i am loath to break our countrys laws
things past redress are now with me past care
my lord of salisbury we have stayd ten days
and hardly kept our countrymen together
and yet we hear no tidings from the king
the king reposeth all his confidence in thee
tis thought the king is dead we will not stay
the baytrees in our country are all witherd
and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven
the palefaced moon looks bloody on the earth
and leanlookd prophets whisper fearful change
rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap
the one in fear to lose what they enjoy
these signs forerun the death or fall of kings
as well assured richard their king is dead
ah richard with the eyes of heavy mind
i see thy glory like a shooting star
fall to the base earth from the firmament
thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west
thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes
and crossly to thy good all fortune goes
bring forth these men
bushy and green i will not vex your souls
since presently your souls must part your bodies
with too much urging your pernicious lives
for twere no charity yet to wash your blood
from off my hands here in the view of men
i will unfold some causes of your deaths
you have misled a prince a royal king
a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments
you have in manner with your sinful hours
made a divorce betwixt his queen and him
broke the possession of a royal bed
and staind the beauty of a fair queens cheeks
with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs
myself a prince by fortune of my birth
near to the king in blood and near in love
till you did make him misinterpret me
have stoopd my neck under your injuries
and sighd my english breath in foreign clouds
eating the bitter bread of banishment
whilst you have fed upon my signories
disparkd my parks and felld my forest woods
from my own windows torn my household coat
razed out my imprese leaving me no sign
save mens opinions and my living blood
to show the world i am a gentleman
this and much more much more than twice all this
condemns you to the death see them deliverd over
to execution and the hand of death
more welcome is the stroke of death to me
than bolingbroke to england lords farewell
my comfort is that heaven will take our souls
and plague injustice with the pains of hell
my lord northumberland see them dispatchd
uncle you say the queen is at your house
tell her i send to her my kind commends
take special care my greetings be deliverd
a gentleman of mine i have dispatchd
with letters of your love to her at large
thank gentle uncle come lords away
awhile to work and after holiday
barkloughly castle call they this at hand
yea my lord how brooks your grace the air
after your late tossing on the breaking seas
to stand upon my kingdom once again
dear earth i do salute thee with my hand
as a longparted mother with her child
plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting
so weeping smiling greet i thee my earth
and do thee favours with my royal hands
feed not thy sovereigns foe my gentle earth
nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense
but let thy spiders that suck up thy venom
and heavygaited toads lie in their way
doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
yield stinging nettles to mine enemies
and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower
guard it i pray thee with a lurking adder
whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
throw death upon thy sovereigns enemies
this earth shall have a feeling and these stones
prove armed soldiers ere her native king
shall falter under foul rebellions arms
hath power to keep you king in spite of all
the means that heaven yields must be embraced
and not neglected else if heaven would
and we will not heavens offer we refuse
the profferd means of succor and redress
he means my lord that we are too remiss
whilst bolingbroke through our security
grows strong and great in substance and in power
discomfortable cousin knowst thou not
that when the searching eye of heaven is hid
behind the globe that lights the lower world
then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
in murders and in outrage boldly here
but when from under this terrestrial ball
he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
and darts his light through every guilty hole
then murders treasons and detested sins
the cloak of night being pluckd from off their backs
stand bare and naked trembling at themselves
so when this thief this traitor bolingbroke
who all this while hath revelld in the night
whilst we were wandering with the antipodes
shall see us rising in our throne the east
his treasons will sit blushing in his face
not able to endure the sight of day
but selfaffrighted tremble at his sin
not all the water in the rough rude sea
can wash the balm off from an anointed king
the breath of worldly men cannot depose
for every man that bolingbroke hath pressd
to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown
god for his richard hath in heavenly pay
weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right
welcome my lord how far off lies your power
nor near nor farther off my gracious lord
and bids me speak of nothing but despair
one day too late i fear me noble lord
o call back yesterday bid time return
and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men
today today unhappy day too late
for all the welshmen hearing thou wert dead
are gone to bolingbroke dispersed and fled
comfort my liege why looks your grace so pale
but now the blood of twenty thousand men
did triumph in my face and they are fled
and till so much blood thither come again
have i not reason to look pale and dead
all souls that will be safe fly from my side
for time hath set a blot upon my pride
comfort my liege remember who you are
i had forgot myself am i not king
awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest
is not the kings name twenty thousand names
arm arm my name a puny subject strikes
at thy great glory look not to the ground
hath power enough to serve our turn but who comes here
more health and happiness betide my liege
than can my caretuned tongue deliver him
mine ear is open and my heart prepared
the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold
say is my kingdom lost why twas my care
and what loss is it to be rid of care
strives bolingbroke to be as great as we
greater he shall not be if he serve god
revolt our subjects that we cannot mend
the worst is death and death will have his day
glad am i that your highness is so armd
to bear the tidings of calamity
like an unseasonable stormy day
which makes the silver rivers drown their shores
as if the world were all dissolved to tears
so high above his limits swells the rage
of bolingbroke covering your fearful land
with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel
whitebeards have armd their thin and hairless scalps
against thy majesty boys with womens voices
strive to speak big and clap their female joints
the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
of doublefatal yew against thy state
yea distaffwomen manage rusty bills
and all goes worse than i have power to tell
too well too well thou tellst a tale so ill
where is the earl of wiltshire where is bagot
what is become of bushy where is green
that they have let the dangerous enemy
measure our confines with such peaceful steps
i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke
peace have they made with him indeed my lord
o villains vipers damnd without redemption
dogs easily won to fawn on any man
snakes in my heartblood warmd that sting my heart
three judases each one thrice worse than judas
would they make peace terrible hell make war
upon their spotted souls for this offence
sweet love i see changing his property
again uncurse their souls their peace is made
with heads and not with hands those whom you curse
have felt the worst of deaths destroying wound
and lie full low graved in the hollow ground
is bushy green and the earl of wiltshire dead
ay all of them at bristol lost their heads
where is the duke my father with his power
lets talk of graves of worms and epitaphs
make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
write sorrow on the bosom of the earth
and yet not so for what can we bequeath
save our deposed bodies to the ground
our lands our lives and all are bolingbrokes
and nothing can we call our own but death
and that small model of the barren earth
which serves as paste and cover to our bones
for gods sake let us sit upon the ground
and tell sad stories of the death of kings
how some have been deposed some slain in war
some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed
that rounds the mortal temples of a king
keeps death his court and there the antic sits
scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp
allowing him a breath a little scene
to monarchize be feard and kill with looks
infusing him with self and vain conceit
as if this flesh which walls about our life
were brass impregnable and humourd thus
comes at the last and with a little pin
bores through his castle wall and farewell king
cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
tradition form and ceremonious duty
i live with bread like you feel want
how can you say to me i am a king
my lord wise men neer sit and wail their woes
but presently prevent the ways to wail
to fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength
gives in your weakness strength unto your foe
and so your follies fight against yourself
and fight and die is death destroying death
where fearing dying pays death servile breath
my father hath a power inquire of him
and learn to make a body of a limb
to change blows with thee for our day of doom
this ague fit of fear is overblown
an easy task it is to win our own
say scroop where lies our uncle with his power
speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour
men judge by the complexion of the sky
so may you by my dull and heavy eye
my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say
i play the torturer by small and small
your uncle york is joind with bolingbroke
and all your northern castles yielded up
and all your southern gentlemen in arms
upon his party
thou hast said enough
beshrew thee cousin which didst lead me forth
of that sweet way i was in to despair
what say you now what comfort have we now
by heaven ill hate him everlastingly
that bids me be of comfort any more
a king woes slave shall kingly woe obey
that power i have discharge and let them go
to ear the land that hath some hope to grow
to alter this for counsel is but vain
my liege one word
he does me double wrong
that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue
from richards night to bolingbrokes fair day
so that by this intelligence we learn
the welshmen are dispersed and salisbury
is gone to meet the king who lately landed
with some few private friends upon this coast
richard not far from hence hath hid his head
it would beseem the lord northumberland
when such a sacred king should hide his head
your grace mistakes only to be brief
left i his title out
the time hath been
would you have been so brief with him he would
have been so brief with you to shorten you
for taking so the head your whole heads length
mistake not uncle further than you should
take not good cousin further than you should
lest you mistake the heavens are oer our heads
i know it uncle and oppose not myself
against their will but who comes here
the castle royally is mannd my lord
against thy entrance
royally
why it contains no king
yes my good lord
it doth contain a king king richard lies
and with him are the lord aumerle lord salisbury
sir stephen scroop besides a clergyman
of holy reverence who i cannot learn
o belike it is the bishop of carlisle
noble lords
go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle
through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
henry bolingbroke
on both his knees doth kiss king richards hand
and sends allegiance and true faith of heart
to his most royal person hither come
even at his feet to lay my arms and power
provided that my banishment repeald
if not ill use the advantage of my power
and lay the summers dust with showers of blood
the which how far off from the mind of bolingbroke
it is such crimson tempest should bedrench
the fresh green lap of fair king richards land
my stooping duty tenderly shall show
go signify as much while here we march
upon the grassy carpet of this plain
lets march without the noise of threatening drum
that from this castles tatterd battlements
our fair appointments may be well perused
methinks king richard and myself should meet
with no less terror than the elements
of fire and water when their thundering shock
at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven
the rage be his whilst on the earth i rain
my waters on the earth and not on him
march on and mark king richard how he looks
see see king richard doth himself appear
as doth the blushing discontented sun
from out the fiery portal of the east
when he perceives the envious clouds are bent
to dim his glory and to stain the track
of his bright passage to the occident
as bright as is the eagles lightens forth
that any harm should stain so fair a show
we are amazed and thus long have we stood
to watch the fearful bending of thy knee
and if we be how dare thy joints forget
to pay their awful duty to our presence
if we be not show us the hand of god
that hath dismissed us from our stewardship
for well we know no hand of blood and bone
can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre
unless he do profane steal or usurp
and though you think that all as you have done
have torn their souls by turning them from us
and we are barren and bereft of friends
yet know my master god omnipotent
is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
armies of pestilence and they shall strike
your children yet unborn and unbegot
that lift your vassal hands against my head
and threat the glory of my precious crown
tell bolingbrokefor yond methinks he stands
that every stride he makes upon my land
the purple testament of bleeding war
but ere the crown he looks for live in peace
ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers sons
shall ill become the flower of englands face
change the complexion of her maidpale peace
to scarlet indignation and bedew
her pastures grass with faithful english blood
the king of heaven forbid our lord the king
should so with civil and uncivil arms
be rushd upon thy thrice noble cousin
harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand
and by the honourable tomb he swears
that stands upon your royal grandsires bones
and by the royalties of both your bloods
currents that spring from one most gracious head
and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt
and by the worth and honour of himself
comprising all that may be sworn or said
his coming hither hath no further scope
than for his lineal royalties and to beg
which on thy royal party granted once
his glittering arms he will commend to rust
his barbed steeds to stables and his heart
to faithful service of your majesty
this swears he as he is a prince is just
and as i am a gentleman i credit him
his noble cousin is right welcome hither
and all the number of his fair demands
with all the gracious utterance thou hast
speak to his gentle hearing kind commends
we do debase ourselves cousin do we not
to look so poorly and to speak so fair
shall we call back northumberland and send
defiance to the traitor and so die
no good my lord lets fight with gentle words
till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords
o god o god that eer this tongue of mine
that laid the sentence of dread banishment
on yon proud man should take it off again
with words of sooth o that i were as great
as is my grief or lesser than my name
or that i could forget what i have been
or not remember what i must be now
swellst thou proud heart ill give thee scope to beat
since foes have scope to beat both thee and me
northumberland comes back from bolingbroke
what must the king do now must he submit
ill give my jewels for a set of beads
my gorgeous palace for a hermitage
my gay apparel for an almsmans gown
my figured goblets for a dish of wood
my sceptre for a palmers walking staff
my subjects for a pair of carved saints
and my large kingdom for a little grave
a little little grave an obscure grave
or ill be buried in the kings highway
some way of common trade where subjects feet
may hourly trample on their sovereigns head
for on my heart they tread now whilst i live
and buried once why not upon my head
aumerle thou weepst my tenderhearted cousin
well make foul weather with despised tears
our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn
and make a dearth in this revolting land
or shall we play the wantons with our woes
and make some pretty match with shedding tears
as thus to drop them still upon one place
till they have fretted us a pair of graves
within the earth and therein laidthere lies
two kinsmen diggd their graves with weeping eyes
would not this ill do well well well i see
i talk but idly and you laugh at me
most mighty prince my lord northumberland
what says king bolingbroke will his majesty
give richard leave to live till richard die
you make a leg and bolingbroke says ay
my lord in the base court he doth attend
to speak with you may it please you to come down
down down i come like glistering phaethon
wanting the manage of unruly jades
in the base court base court where kings grow base
to come at traitors calls and do them grace
in the base court come down down court
down king
for nightowls shriek where mounting larks
should sing
what says his majesty
sorrow and grief of heart
makes him speak fondly like a frantic man
yet he is come
stand all apart
and show fair duty to his majesty
my gracious lord
fair cousin you debase your princely knee
me rather had my heart might feel your love
than my unpleased eye see your courtesy
up cousin up your heart is up i know
thus high at least although your knee be low
my gracious lord i come but for mine own
your own is yours and i am yours and all
so far be mine my most redoubted lord
as my true service shall deserve your love
that know the strongst and surest way to get
tears show their love but want their remedies
cousin i am too young to be your father
though you are old enough to be my heir
what you will have ill give and willing too
for do we must what force will have us do
set on towards london cousin is it so
yea my good lord
then i must not say no
what sport shall we devise here in this garden
to drive away the heavy thought of care
madam well play at bowls
twill make me think the world is full of rubs
and that my fortune rubs against the bias
madam well dance
my legs can keep no measure in delight
therefore no dancing girl some other sport
madam well tell tales
of sorrow or of joy
of either madam
for of joy being altogether wanting
it doth remember me the more of sorrow
or if of grief being altogether had
for what i have i need not to repeat
and what i want it boots not to complain
madam ill sing
tis well that thou hast cause
but thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep
i could weep madam would it do you good
and i could sing would weeping do me good
and never borrow any tear of thee
lets step into the shadow of these trees
my wretchedness unto a row of pins
theyll talk of state for every one doth so
against a change woe is forerun with woe
go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks
which like unruly children make their sire
give some supportance to the bending twigs
go thou and like an executioner
cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays
all must be even in our government
you thus employd i will go root away
the noisome weeds which without profit suck
the soils fertility from wholesome flowers
why should we in the compass of a pale
keep law and form and due proportion
showing as in a model our firm estate
when our seawalled garden the whole land
is full of weeds her fairest flowers choked up
her fruittrees all upturned her hedges ruind
her knots disorderd and her wholesome herbs
swarming with caterpillars
he that hath sufferd this disorderd spring
the weeds which his broadspreading leaves did shelter
that seemd in eating him to hold him up
are pluckd up root and all by bolingbroke
i mean the earl of wiltshire bushy green
what are they dead
they are and bolingbroke
hath seized the wasteful king o what pity is it
that he had not so trimmd and dressd his land
as we this garden we at time of year
do wound the bark the skin of our fruittrees
lest being overproud in sap and blood
had he done so to great and growing men
they might have lived to bear and he to taste
had he done so himself had borne the crown
which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down
what think you then the king shall be deposed
depressd he is already and deposed
to a dear friend of the good duke of yorks
that tell black tidings
o i am pressd to death through want of speaking
thou old adams likeness set to dress this garden
how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news
what eve what serpent hath suggested thee
to make a second fall of cursed man
why dost thou say king richard is deposed
darest thou thou little better thing than earth
divine his downfall say where when and how
camest thou by this ill tidings speak thou wretch
to breathe this news yet what i say is true
king richard he is in the mighty hold
in your lords scale is nothing but himself
and some few vanities that make him light
but in the balance of great bolingbroke
besides himself are all the english peers
and with that odds he weighs king richard down
post you to london and you will find it so
i speak no more than every one doth know
nimble mischance that art so light of foot
doth not thy embassage belong to me
and am i last that knows it o thou thinkst
to serve me last that i may longest keep
thy sorrow in my breast come ladies go
to meet at london londons king in woe
what was i born to this that my sad look
should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke
gardener for telling me these news of woe
pray god the plants thou graftst may never grow
poor queen so that thy state might be no worse
i would my skill were subject to thy curse
here did she fall a tear here in this place
rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen
in the remembrance of a weeping queen
call forth bagot
now bagot freely speak thy mind
what thou dost know of noble gloucesters death
who wrought it with the king and who performd
the bloody office of his timeless end
then set before my face the lord aumerle
cousin stand forth and look upon that man
my lord aumerle i know your daring tongue
scorns to unsay what once it hath deliverd
in that dead time when gloucesters death was plotted
i heard you say is not my arm of length
that reacheth from the restful english court
as far as calais to mine uncles head
amongst much other talk that very time
i heard you say that you had rather refuse
the offer of an hundred thousand crowns
than bolingbrokes return to england
adding withal how blest this land would be
in this your cousins death
princes and noble lords
what answer shall i make to this base man
shall i so much dishonour my fair stars
on equal terms to give him chastisement
either i must or have mine honour soild
with the attainder of his slanderous lips
there is my gage the manual seal of death
and will maintain what thou hast said is false
in thy heartblood though being all too base
to stain the temper of my knightly sword
bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up
excepting one i would he were the best
in all this presence that hath moved me so
if that thy valour stand on sympathy
by that fair sun which shows me where thou standst
i heard thee say and vauntingly thou spakest it
that thou wert cause of noble gloucesters death
if thou denyst it twenty times thou liest
and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart
where it was forged with my rapiers point
thou darest not coward live to see that day
now by my soul i would it were this hour
fitzwater thou art damnd to hell for this
aumerle thou liest his honour is as true
in this appeal as thou art all unjust
and that thou art so there i throw my gage
to prove it on thee to the extremest point
an if i do not may my hands rot off
and never brandish more revengeful steel
over the glittering helmet of my foe
i task the earth to the like forsworn aumerle
and spur thee on with full as many lies
as may be holload in thy treacherous ear
engage it to the trial if thou darest
i have a thousand spirits in one breast
to answer twenty thousand such as you
my lord fitzwater i do remember well
the very time aumerle and you did talk
and you can witness with me this is true
as false by heaven as heaven itself is true
surrey thou liest
dishonourable boy
that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword
that it shall render vengeance and revenge
till thou the liegiver and that lie do lie
in proof whereof there is my honours pawn
engage it to the trial if thou darest
how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse
if i dare eat or drink or breathe or live
i dare meet surrey in a wilderness
and spit upon him whilst i say he lies
to tie thee to my strong correction
as i intend to thrive in this new world
besides i heard the banishd norfolk say
that thou aumerle didst send two of thy men
to execute the noble duke at calais
some honest christian trust me with a gage
if he may be repeald to try his honour
these differences shall all rest under gage
and though mine enemy restored again
against aumerle we will enforce his trial
that honourable day shall neer be seen
many a time hath banishd norfolk fought
for jesu christ in glorious christian field
streaming the ensign of the christian cross
and toild with works of war retired himself
to italy and there at venice gave
his body to that pleasant countrys earth
and his pure soul unto his captain christ
under whose colours he had fought so long
why bishop is norfolk dead
as surely as i live my lord
sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
of good old abraham lords appellants
your differences shall all rest under gage
till we assign you to your days of trial
great duke of lancaster i come to thee
from plumepluckd richard who with willing soul
adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields
ascend his throne descending now from him
and long live henry fourth of that name
in gods name ill ascend the regal throne
marry god forbid
worst in this royal presence may i speak
yet best beseeming me to speak the truth
would god that any in this noble presence
were enough noble to be upright judge
of noble richard then true noblesse would
learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong
what subject can give sentence on his king
and who sits here that is not richards subject
thieves are not judged but they are by to hear
although apparent guilt be seen in them
and shall the figure of gods majesty
his captain steward deputyelect
anointed crowned planted many years
be judged by subject and inferior breath
and he himself not present o forfend it god
that in a christian climate souls refined
should show so heinous black obscene a deed
i speak to subjects and a subject speaks
my lord of hereford here whom you call king
the blood of english shall manure the ground
and future ages groan for this foul act
peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels
and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound
disorder horror fear and mutiny
shall here inhabit and this land be calld
the field of golgotha and dead mens skulls
o if you raise this house against this house
it will the woefullest division prove
that ever fell upon this cursed earth
prevent it resist it let it not be so
lest child childs children cry against you woe
well have you argued sir and for your pains
of capital treason we arrest you here
my lord of westminster be it your charge
to keep him safely till his day of trial
may it please you lords to grant the commons suit
fetch hither richard that in common view
he may surrender so we shall proceed
without suspicion
i will be his conduct
lords you that here are under our arrest
procure your sureties for your days of answer
little are we beholding to your love
and little lookd for at your helping hands
alack why am i sent for to a king
before i have shook off the regal thoughts
wherewith i reignd i hardly yet have learnd
give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
to this submission yet i well remember
did they not sometime cry all hail to me
god save the king will no man say amen
am i both priest and clerk well then amen
god save the king although i be not he
and yet amen if heaven do think him me
to do what service am i sent for hither
to do that office of thine own good will
which tired majesty did make thee offer
the resignation of thy state and crown
to henry bolingbroke
give me the crown here cousin seize the crown
on this side my hand and on that side yours
now is this golden crown like a deep well
that owes two buckets filling one another
the emptier ever dancing in the air
that bucket down and full of tears am i
drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high
i thought you had been willing to resign
you may my glories and my state depose
but not my griefs still am i king of those
part of your cares you give me with your crown
your cares set up do not pluck my cares down
my care is loss of care by old care done
the cares i give i have though given away
they tend the crown yet still with me they stay
are you contented to resign the crown
ay no no ay for i must nothing be
therefore no no for i resign to thee
now mark me how i will undo myself
i give this heavy weight from off my head
and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand
the pride of kingly sway from out my heart
with mine own tears i wash away my balm
with mine own hands i give away my crown
with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
all pomp and majesty i do forswear
my manors rents revenues i forego
god pardon all oaths that are broke to me
god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee
make me that nothing have with nothing grieved
and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved
long mayst thou live in richards seat to sit
and soon lie richard in an earthly pit
god save king harry unkingd richard says
and send him many years of sunshine days
what more remains
no more but that you read
these accusations and these grievous crimes
committed by your person and your followers
against the state and profit of this land
that by confessing them the souls of men
may deem that you are worthily deposed
must i do so and must i ravel out
my weavedup folly gentle northumberland
if thy offences were upon record
would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
to read a lecture of them if thou wouldst
there shouldst thou find one heinous article
containing the deposing of a king
and cracking the strong warrant of an oath
nay all of you that stand and look upon
whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself
though some of you with pilate wash your hands
showing an outward pity yet you pilates
have here deliverd me to my sour cross
and water cannot wash away your sin
my lord dispatch read oer these articles
and yet salt water blinds them not so much
but they can see a sort of traitors here
nay if i turn mine eyes upon myself
i find myself a traitor with the rest
for i have given here my souls consent
to undeck the pompous body of a king
made glory base and sovereignty a slave
proud majesty a subject state a peasant
my lord
no lord of thine thou haught insulting man
nor no mans lord i have no name no title
no not that name was given me at the font
that i have worn so many winters out
and know not now what name to call myself
o that i were a mockery king of snow
standing before the sun of bolingbroke
to melt myself away in waterdrops
good king great king and yet not greatly good
an if my word be sterling yet in england
let it command a mirror hither straight
that it may show me what a face i have
since it is bankrupt of his majesty
go some of you and fetch a lookingglass
read oer this paper while the glass doth come
fiend thou tormentst me ere i come to hell
urge it no more my lord northumberland
the commons will not then be satisfied
when i do see the very book indeed
where all my sins are writ and thats myself
give me the glass and therein will i read
no deeper wrinkles yet hath sorrow struck
so many blows upon this face of mine
and made no deeper wounds o flattering glass
like to my followers in prosperity
thou dost beguile me was this face the face
that every day under his household roof
did keep ten thousand men was this the face
that like the sun did make beholders wink
was this the face that faced so many follies
and was at last outfaced by bolingbroke
as brittle as the glory is the face
for there it is crackd in a hundred shivers
mark silent king the moral of this sport
how soon my sorrow hath destroyd my face
the shadow of your sorrow hath destroyd
the shadow or your face
say that again
tis very true my grief lies all within
and these external manners of laments
are merely shadows to the unseen grief
that swells with silence in the tortured soul
for thy great bounty that not only givest
me cause to wail but teachest me the way
how to lament the cause ill beg one boon
and then be gone and trouble you no more
shall i obtain it
name it fair cousin
for when i was a king my flatterers
were then but subjects being now a subject
i have a king here to my flatterer
being so great i have no need to beg
yet ask
and shall i have
you shall
then give me leave to go
whither
whither you will so i were from your sights
go some of you convey him to the tower
o good convey conveyers are you all
that rise thus nimbly by a true kings fall
on wednesday next we solemnly set down
a woeful pageant have we here beheld
the woes to come the children yet unborn
shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn
you holy clergymen is there no plot
to rid the realm of this pernicious blot
my lord
before i freely speak my mind herein
you shall not only take the sacrament
to bury mine intents but also to effect
whatever i shall happen to devise
i see your brows are full of discontent
come home with me to supper and ill lay
a plot shall show us all a merry day
this way the king will come this is the way
to julius caesars illerected tower
to whose flint bosom my condemned lord
here let us rest if this rebellious earth
have any resting for her true kings queen
but soft but see or rather do not see
that you in pity may dissolve to dew
and wash him fresh again with truelove tears
ah thou the model where old troy did stand
thou map of honour thou king richards tomb
and not king richard thou most beauteous inn
why should hardfavourd grief be lodged in thee
when triumph is become an alehouse guest
join not with grief fair woman do not so
to think our former state a happy dream
from which awaked the truth of what we are
to grim necessity and he and i
will keep a league till death hie thee to france
our holy lives must win a new worlds crown
which our profane hours here have stricken down
what is my richard both in shape and mind
transformd and weakend hath bolingbroke deposed
thine intellect hath he been in thy heart
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw
and wounds the earth if nothing else with rage
to be oerpowerd and wilt thou pupillike
take thy correction mildly kiss the rod
and fawn on rage with base humility
which art a lion and a king of beasts
a king of beasts indeed if aught but beasts
i had been still a happy king of men
think i am dead and that even here thou takest
as from my deathbed thy last living leave
in winters tedious nights sit by the fire
with good old folks and let them tell thee tales
of woeful ages long ago betid
and ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs
tell thou the lamentable tale of me
for why the senseless brands will sympathize
the heavy accent of thy moving tongue
and in compassion weep the fire out
and some will mourn in ashes some coalblack
for the deposing of a rightful king
you must to pomfret not unto the tower
and madam there is order taen for you
with all swift speed you must away to france
northumberland thou ladder wherewithal
the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne
the time shall not be many hours of age
more than it is ere foul sin gathering head
though he divide the realm and give thee half
it is too little helping him to all
and he shall think that thou which knowst the way
to plant unrightful kings wilt know again
being neer so little urged another way
to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne
the love of wicked men converts to fear
that fear to hate and hate turns one or both
to worthy danger and deserved death
my guilt be on my head and there an end
take leave and part for you must part forthwith
doubly divorced bad men you violate
a twofold marriage twixt my crown and me
and then betwixt me and my married wife
let me unkiss the oath twixt thee and me
and yet not so for with a kiss twas made
part us northumberland i toward the north
where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime
she came adorned hither like sweet may
sent back like hallowmas or shortst of day
and must we be divided must we part
ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart
banish us both and send the king with me
that were some love but little policy
then whither he goes thither let me go
so two together weeping make one woe
weep thou for me in france i for thee here
better far off than near be neer the near
go count thy way with sighs i mine with groans
so longest way shall have the longest moans
twice for one step ill groan the way being short
and piece the way out with a heavy heart
come come in wooing sorrow lets be brief
since wedding it there is such length in grief
one kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part
thus give i mine and thus take i thy heart
give me mine own again twere no good part
to take on me to keep and kill thy heart
so now i have mine own again be gone
that i might strive to kill it with a groan
once more adieu the rest let sorrow say
my lord you told me you would tell the rest
when weeping made you break the story off
of our two cousins coming into london
where did i leave
at that sad stop my lord
where rude misgovernd hands from windows tops
threw dust and rubbish on king richards head
then as i said the duke great bolingbroke
mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
which his aspiring rider seemd to know
with slow but stately pace kept on his course
whilst all tongues cried god save thee
bolingbroke
you would have thought the very windows spake
so many greedy looks of young and old
through casements darted their desiring eyes
upon his visage and that all the walls
with painted imagery had said at once
jesu preserve thee welcome bolingbroke
whilst he from the one side to the other turning
bareheaded lower than his proud steeds neck
and thus still doing thus he passd along
alack poor richard where rode he the whilst
as in a theatre the eyes of men
after a wellgraced actor leaves the stage
are idly bent on him that enters next
thinking his prattle to be tedious
even so or with much more contempt mens eyes
did scowl on gentle richard no man cried god save him
which with such gentle sorrow he shook off
his face still combating with tears and smiles
the badges of his grief and patience
that had not god for some strong purpose steeld
the hearts of men they must perforce have melted
and barbarism itself have pitied him
but heaven hath a hand in these events
to whose high will we bound our calm contents
to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now
whose state and honour i for aye allow
here comes my son aumerle
aumerle that was
but that is lost for being richards friend
i am in parliament pledge for his truth
and lasting fealty to the newmade king
that strew the green lap of the new come spring
god knows i had as lief be none as one
well bear you well in this new spring of time
lest you be croppd before you come to prime
what news from oxford hold those justs and triumphs
for aught i know my lord they do
you will be there i know
if god prevent not i purpose so
what seal is that that hangs without thy bosom
yea lookst thou pale let me see the writing
my lord tis nothing
no matter then who see it
i will be satisfied let me see the writing
it is a matter of small consequence
which for some reasons i would not have seen
which for some reasons sir i mean to see
i fear i fear
what should you fear
tis nothing but some bond that he is enterd into
for gay apparel gainst the triumph day
bound to himself what doth he with a bond
that he is bound to wife thou art a fool
boy let me see the writing
i do beseech you pardon me i may not show it
i will be satisfied let me see it i say
treason foul treason villain traitor slave
what is the matter my lord
ho who is within there
saddle my horse
god for his mercy what treachery is here
why what is it my lord
give me my boots i say saddle my horse
now by mine honour by my life by my troth
i will appeach the villain
what is the matter
peace foolish woman
i will not peace what is the matter aumerle
good mother be content it is no more
than my poor life must answer
thy life answer
strike him aumerle poor boy thou art amazed
hence villain never more come in my sight
give me my boots i say
why york what wilt thou do
wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own
have we more sons or are we like to have
is not my teeming date drunk up with time
and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age
and rob me of a happy mothers name
is he not like thee is he not thine own
thou fond mad woman
wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy
a dozen of them here have taen the sacrament
and interchangeably set down their hands
to kill the king at oxford
he shall be none
away fond woman were he twenty times my son
i would appeach him
hadst thou groand for him
as i have done thou wouldst be more pitiful
but now i know thy mind thou dost suspect
that i have been disloyal to thy bed
he is as like thee as a man may be
not like to me or any of my kin
and yet i love him
make way unruly woman
after aumerle mount thee upon his horse
spur post and get before him to the king
and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee
ill not be long behind though i be old
and never will i rise up from the ground
till bolingbroke have pardond thee away be gone
can no man tell me of my unthrifty son
tis full three months since i did see him last
if any plague hang over us tis he
inquire at london mongst the taverns there
for there they say he daily doth frequent
with unrestrained loose companions
even such they say as stand in narrow lanes
and beat our watch and rob our passengers
which he young wanton and effeminate boy
takes on the point of honour to support
so dissolute a crew
my lord some two days since i saw the prince
and told him of those triumphs held at oxford
and what said the gallant
his answer was he would unto the stews
and from the commonst creature pluck a glove
and wear it as a favour and with that
he would unhorse the lustiest challenger
as dissolute as desperate yet through both
i see some sparks of better hope which elder years
may happily bring forth but who comes here
where is the king
what means our cousin that he stares and looks
so wildly
god save your grace i do beseech your majesty
to have some conference with your grace alone
withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone
what is the matter with our cousin now
for ever may my knees grow to the earth
my tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
unless a pardon ere i rise or speak
intended or committed was this fault
if on the first how heinous eer it be
to win thy afterlove i pardon thee
then give me leave that i may turn the key
that no man enter till my tale be done
have thy desire
villain ill make thee safe
stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear
what is the matter uncle speak
recover breath tell us how near is danger
that we may arm us to encounter it
peruse this writing here and thou shalt know
the treason that my haste forbids me show
i do repent me read not my name there
my heart is not confederate with my hand
it was villain ere thy hand did set it down
i tore it from the traitors bosom king
forget to pity him lest thy pity prove
a serpent that will sting thee to the heart
o heinous strong and bold conspiracy
o loyal father of a treacherous son
thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain
from when this stream through muddy passages
hath held his current and defiled himself
thy overflow of good converts to bad
and thy abundant goodness shall excuse
this deadly blot in thy digressing son
so shall my virtue be his vices bawd
and he shall spend mine honour with his shame
as thriftless sons their scraping fathers gold
mine honour lives when his dishonour dies
thou killst me in his life giving him breath
the traitor lives the true mans put to death
what shrillvoiced suppliant makes this eager cry
a woman and thy aunt great king tis i
speak with me pity me open the door
a beggar begs that never beggd before
our scene is alterd from a serious thing
and now changed to the beggar and the king
i know she is come to pray for your foul sin
if thou do pardon whosoever pray
more sins for this forgiveness prosper may
this festerd joint cut off the rest rest sound
this let alone will all the rest confound
o king believe not this hardhearted man
love loving not itself none other can
thou frantic woman what dost thou make here
shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear
sweet york be patient hear me gentle liege
rise up good aunt
for ever will i walk upon my knees
and never see day that the happy sees
till thou give joy until thou bid me joy
by pardoning rutland my transgressing boy
unto my mothers prayers i bend my knee
against them both my true joints bended be
ill mayst thou thrive if thou grant any grace
pleads he in earnest look upon his face
his eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest
he prays but faintly and would be denied
his weary joints would gladly rise i know
his prayers are full of false hypocrisy
ours of true zeal and deep integrity
our prayers do outpray his then let them have
that mercy which true prayer ought to have
good aunt stand up
nay do not say stand up
say pardon first and afterwards stand up
and if i were thy nurse thy tongue to teach
pardon should be the first word of thy speech
i never longd to hear a word till now
the word is short but not so short as sweet
no word like pardon for kings mouths so meet
speak it in french king say pardonne moi
dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy
ah my sour husband my hardhearted lord
that setst the word itself against the word
speak pardon as tis current in our land
the chopping french we do not understand
thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there
or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear
that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce
pity may move thee pardon to rehearse
good aunt stand up
i do not sue to stand
pardon is all the suit i have in hand
i pardon him as god shall pardon me
o happy vantage of a kneeling knee
twice saying pardon doth not pardon twain
but makes one pardon strong
with all my heart
i pardon him
a god on earth thou art
but for our trusty brotherinlaw and the abbot
with all the rest of that consorted crew
destruction straight shall dog them at the heels
good uncle help to order several powers
they shall not live within this world i swear
but i will have them if i once know where
your mother well hath prayd and prove you true
didst thou not mark the king what words he spake
have i no friend will rid me of this living fear
was it not so
these were his very words
and urged it twice together did he not
he did
and speaking it he wistly lookd on me
and who should say i would thou wert the man
that would divorce this terror from my heart
i am the kings friend and will rid his foe
i have been studying how i may compare
and for because the world is populous
and here is not a creature but myself
i cannot do it yet ill hammer it out
my brain ill prove the female to my soul
my soul the father and these two beget
a generation of stillbreeding thoughts
and these same thoughts people this little world
in humours like the people of this world
for no thought is contented the better sort
as thoughts of things divine are intermixd
with scruples and do set the word itself
as thus come little ones and then again
it is as hard to come as for a camel
to thread the postern of a small needles eye
thoughts tending to ambition they do plot
unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails
may tear a passage through the flinty ribs
of this hard world my ragged prison walls
and for they cannot die in their own pride
thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
that they are not the first of fortunes slaves
nor shall not be the last like silly beggars
who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame
that many have and others must sit there
and in this thought they find a kind of ease
bearing their own misfortunes on the back
of such as have before endured the like
thus play i in one person many people
then treasons make me wish myself a beggar
persuades me i was better when a king
think that i am unkingd by bolingbroke
nor i nor any man that but man is
with nothing shall be pleased till he be eased
with being nothing music do i hear
when time is broke and no proportion kept
so is it in the music of mens lives
and here have i the daintiness of ear
to cheque time broke in a disorderd string
but for the concord of my state and time
had not an ear to hear my true time broke
i wasted time and now doth time waste me
my thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar
their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch
whereto my finger like a dials point
is pointing still in cleansing them from tears
now sir the sound that tells what hour it is
are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart
runs posting on in bolingbrokes proud joy
while i stand fooling here his jack o the clock
this music mads me let it sound no more
for though it have holp madmen to their wits
in me it seems it will make wise men mad
yet blessing on his heart that gives it me
for tis a sign of love and love to richard
is a strange brooch in this allhating world
hail royal prince
thanks noble peer
the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear
what art thou and how comest thou hither
where no man never comes but that sad dog
that brings me food to make misfortune live
i was a poor groom of thy stable king
when thou wert king who travelling towards york
with much ado at length have gotten leave
to look upon my sometimes royal masters face
o how it yearnd my heart when i beheld
in london streets that coronationday
when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary
that horse that thou so often hast bestrid
that horse that i so carefully have dressd
rode he on barbary tell me gentle friend
how went he under him
so proudly as if he disdaind the ground
so proud that bolingbroke was on his back
that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand
this hand hath made him proud with clapping him
would he not stumble would he not fall down
since pride must have a fall and break the neck
of that proud man that did usurp his back
forgiveness horse why do i rail on thee
since thou created to be awed by man
wast born to bear i was not made a horse
and yet i bear a burthen like an ass
spurrd galld and tired by jouncing bolingbroke
fellow give place here is no longer stay
if thou love me tis time thou wert away
what my tongue dares not that my heart shall say
my lord willt please you to fall to
taste of it first as thou art wont to do
lately came from the king commands the contrary
the devil take henry of lancaster and thee
patience is stale and i am weary of it
help help help
how now what means death in this rude assault
villain thy own hand yields thy deaths instrument
go thou and fill another room in hell
that hand shall burn in neverquenching fire
that staggers thus my person exton thy fierce hand
hath with the kings blood staind the kings own land
mount mount my soul thy seat is up on high
whilst my gross flesh sinks downward here to die
both have i spilld o would the deed were good
for now the devil that told me i did well
says that this deed is chronicled in hell
this dead king to the living king ill bear
take hence the rest and give them burial here
kind uncle york the latest news we hear
is that the rebels have consumed with fire
our town of cicester in gloucestershire
but whether they be taen or slain we hear not
welcome my lord what is the news
first to thy sacred state wish i all happiness

at large discoursed in this paper here
we thank thee gentle percy for thy pains
and to thy worth will add right worthy gains
my lord i have from oxford sent to london
the heads of brocas and sir bennet seely
two of the dangerous consorted traitors
that sought at oxford thy dire overthrow
thy pains fitzwater shall not be forgot
right noble is thy merit well i wot
the grand conspirator abbot of westminster
with clog of conscience and sour melancholy
hath yielded up his body to the grave
but here is carlisle living to abide
thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride
choose out some secret place some reverend room
more than thou hast and with it joy thy life
for though mine enemy thou hast ever been
high sparks of honour in thee have i seen
great king within this coffin i present

a deed of slander with thy fatal hand
upon my head and all this famous land

will they not hear what ho you men you beasts
that quench the fire of your pernicious rage
with purple fountains issuing from your veins
on pain of torture from those bloody hands
throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground
and hear the sentence of your moved prince
three civil brawls bred of an airy word
by thee old capulet and montague
have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets
and made veronas ancient citizens
cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
to wield old partisans in hands as old
if ever you disturb our streets again
your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace
and montague come you this afternoon
to know our further pleasure in this case
to old freetown our common judgmentplace
once more on pain of death all men depart
who set this ancient quarrel new abroach
speak nephew were you by when it began
here were the servants of your adversary
the fiery tybalt with his sword prepared
which as he breathed defiance to my ears
he swung about his head and cut the winds
while we were interchanging thrusts and blows
came more and more and fought on part and part
till the prince came who parted either part
o where is romeo saw you him today
right glad i am he was not at this fray
madam an hour before the worshippd sun
peerd forth the golden window of the east
a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad
where underneath the grove of sycamore
that westward rooteth from the citys side
towards him i made but he was ware of me
i measuring his affections by my own
that most are busied when theyre most alone
pursued my humour not pursuing his
and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me
many a morning hath he there been seen
with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs
but all so soon as the allcheering sun
should in the furthest east begin to draw
the shady curtains from auroras bed
away from the light steals home my heavy son
and private in his chamber pens himself
shuts up his windows locks far daylight out
black and portentous must this humour prove
unless good counsel may the cause remove
my noble uncle do you know the cause
i neither know it nor can learn of him
have you importuned him by any means
but he his own affections counsellor
is to himselfi will not say how true
but to himself so secret and so close
so far from sounding and discovery
as is the bud bit with an envious worm
ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
or dedicate his beauty to the sun
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow
we would as willingly give cure as know
ill know his grievance or be much denied
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay
to hear true shrift come madam lets away
goodmorrow cousin
is the day so young
but new struck nine
ay me sad hours seem long
was that my father that went hence so fast
it was what sadness lengthens romeos hours
not having that which having makes them short
in love
out
of love
out of her favour where i am in love
alas that love so gentle in his view
should be so tyrannous and rough in proof
alas that love whose view is muffled still
should without eyes see pathways to his will
where shall we dine o me what fray was here
yet tell me not for i have heard it all
heres much to do with hate but more with love
why then o brawling love o loving hate
o any thing of nothing first create
o heavy lightness serious vanity
misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms
feather of lead bright smoke cold fire
sick health
stillwaking sleep that is not what it is
this love feel i that feel no love in this
dost thou not laugh
no coz i rather weep
good heart at what
at thy good hearts oppression
why such is loves transgression
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
doth add more grief to too much of mine own
love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs
being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes
what is it else a madness most discreet
a choking gall and a preserving sweet
farewell my coz
soft i will go along
an if you leave me so you do me wrong
tut i have lost myself i am not here
this is not romeo hes some other where
tell me in sadness who is that you love
what shall i groan and tell thee
groan why no
but sadly tell me who
ah word ill urged to one that is so ill
in sadness cousin i do love a woman
i aimd so near when i supposed you loved
a right good markman and shes fair i love
a right fair mark fair coz is soonest hit
with cupids arrow she hath dians wit
and in strong proof of chastity well armd
from loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd
she will not stay the siege of loving terms
nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes
o she is rich in beauty only poor
that when she dies with beauty dies her store
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste
for beauty starved with her severity
cuts beauty off from all posterity
she is too fair too wise wisely too fair
she hath forsworn to love and in that vow
do i live dead that live to tell it now
be ruled by me forget to think of her
o teach me how i should forget to think
by giving liberty unto thine eyes
examine other beauties
tis the way
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows
being black put us in mind they hide the fair
he that is strucken blind cannot forget
show me a mistress that is passing fair
what doth her beauty serve but as a note
where i may read who passd that passing fair
ill pay that doctrine or else die in debt
but montague is bound as well as i
in penalty alike and tis not hard i think
for men so old as we to keep the peace
of honourable reckoning are you both
and pity tis you lived at odds so long
but now my lord what say you to my suit
my child is yet a stranger in the world
she hath not seen the change of fourteen years
let two more summers wither in their pride
ere we may think her ripe to be a bride
younger than she are happy mothers made
and too soon marrd are those so early made
the earth hath swallowd all my hopes but she
but woo her gentle paris get her heart
my will to her consent is but a part
an she agree within her scope of choice
lies my consent and fair according voice
this night i hold an old accustomd feast
whereto i have invited many a guest
such as i love and you among the store
one more most welcome makes my number more
at my poor house look to behold this night
such comfort as do lusty young men feel
when wellapparelld april on the heel
of limping winter treads even such delight
among fresh female buds shall you this night
inherit at my house hear all all see
which on more view of many mine being one
may stand in number though in reckoning none
come go with me
go sirrah trudge about
through fair verona find those persons out
whose names are written there and to them say
my house and welcome on their pleasure stay
find them out whose names are written here it is
written that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard and the tailor with his last the fisher with
his pencil and the painter with his nets but i am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ i must to the learnedin good time
tut man one fire burns out anothers burning

take thou some new infection to thy eye
and the rank poison of the old will die
your plaintainleaf is excellent for that

and she was weandi never shall forget it
for i had then laid wormwood to my dug
sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall
when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
of my dug and felt it bitter pretty fool
to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug
and since that time it is eleven years
for then she could stand alone nay by the rood
she could have run and waddled all about

and pretty fool it stinted and said ay

to think it should leave crying and say ay
and yet i warrant it had upon its brow

wilt thou not jule it stinted and said ay
and stint thou too i pray thee nurse say i
peace i have done god mark thee to his grace
an i might live to see thee married once

i came to talk of tell me daughter juliet
how stands your disposition to be married
it is an honour that i dream not of
an honour were not i thine only nurse
i would say thou hadst suckd wisdom from thy teat
well think of marriage now younger than you
here in verona ladies of esteem
i was your mother much upon these years
the valiant paris seeks you for his love
a man young lady lady such a man
as all the worldwhy hes a man of wax
veronas summer hath not such a flower
nay hes a flower in faith a very flower
what say you can you love the gentleman
this night you shall behold him at our feast
read oer the volume of young paris face
and find delight writ there with beautys pen
examine every married lineament
and see how one another lends content
and what obscured in this fair volume lies
find written in the margent of his eyes
this precious book of love this unbound lover
the fish lives in the sea and tis much pride
that book in manys eyes doth share the glory
that in gold clasps locks in the golden story
so shall you share all that he doth possess
by having him making yourself no less
no less nay bigger women grow by men
speak briefly can you like of paris love
but no more deep will i endart mine eye
than your consent gives strength to make it fly
madam the guests are come supper served up you
called my young lady asked for the nurse cursed in
the pantry and every thing in extremity i must
hence to wait i beseech you follow straight
we follow thee
juliet the county stays
go girl seek happy nights to happy days
what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
or shall we on without a apology
well have no cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf
bearing a tartars painted bow of lath
scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper
nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke
but let them measure us by what they will
well measure them a measure and be gone
being but heavy i will bear the light
nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
so stakes me to the ground i cannot move
you are a lover borrow cupids wings
and soar with them above a common bound
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft
to soar with his light feathers and so bound
under loves heavy burden do i sink
and to sink in it should you burden love
too great oppression for a tender thing
is love a tender thing it is too rough
too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn
if love be rough with you be rough with love
prick love for pricking and you beat love down
a visor for a visor what care i
what curious eye doth quote deformities
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
come knock and enter and no sooner in
but every man betake him to his legs
tickle the senseless rushes with their heels
for i am proverbd with a grandsire phrase
ill be a candleholder and look on
the game was neer so fair and i am done
if thou art dun well draw thee from the mire
of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst
up to the ears come we burn daylight ho
nay thats not so
i mean sir in delay
we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
take our good meaning for our judgment sits
five times in that ere once in our five wits
and we mean well in going to this mask
but tis no wit to go
why may one ask
i dreamd a dream tonight
and so did i
well what was yours
that dreamers often lie
in bed asleep while they do dream things true
o then i see queen mab hath been with you
she is the fairies midwife and she comes
in shape no bigger than an agatestone
on the forefinger of an alderman
drawn with a team of little atomies
athwart mens noses as they lie asleep
her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs
the cover of the wings of grasshoppers
the traces of the smallest spiders web
the collars of the moonshines watery beams
her whip of crickets bone the lash of film
her wagoner a small greycoated gnat
not so big as a round little worm
prickd from the lazy finger of a maid
her chariot is an empty hazelnut
made by the joiner squirrel or old grub
time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
and in this state she gallops night by night
through lovers brains and then they dream of love
oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight
oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees
oer ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream
which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues
sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose
and then dreams he of smelling out a suit
and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail
tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep
sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck
and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats
of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades
of healths fivefathom deep and then anon
drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes
and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
and sleeps again this is that very mab
that plats the manes of horses in the night
and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs
this is the hag when maids lie on their backs
that presses them and learns them first to bear
this is she
peace peace mercutio peace
thou talkst of nothing
true i talk of dreams
which are the children of an idle brain
begot of nothing but vain fantasy
which is as thin of substance as the air
and more inconstant than the wind who wooes
even now the frozen bosom of the north
and being angerd puffs away from thence
turning his face to the dewdropping south
this wind you talk of blows us from ourselves
supper is done and we shall come too late
some consequence yet hanging in the stars
shall bitterly begin his fearful date
with this nights revels and expire the term
of a despised life closed in my breast
by some vile forfeit of untimely death
but he that hath the steerage of my course
direct my sail on lusty gentlemen
strike drum
wheres potpan that he helps not to take away he
shift a trencher he scrape a trencher
when good manners shall lie all in one or two mens
hands and they unwashed too tis a foul thing
away with the jointstools remove the
courtcupboard look to the plate good thou save
me a piece of marchpane and as thou lovest me let
the porter let in susan grindstone and nell
antony and potpan
ay boy ready
you are looked for and called for asked for and
sought for in the great chamber
we cannot be here and there too cheerly boys be
brisk awhile and the longer liver take all
welcome gentlemen ladies that have their toes
unplagued with corns will have a bout with you
ah ha my mistresses which of you all
will now deny to dance she that makes dainty
she ill swear hath corns am i come near ye now
welcome gentlemen i have seen the day
that i have worn a visor and could tell
a whispering tale in a fair ladys ear
you are welcome gentlemen come musicians play

and quench the fire the room is grown too hot
ah sirrah this unlookdfor sport comes well

some five and twenty years and then we maskd
tis more tis more his son is elder sir
his son is thirty
will you tell me that
his son was but a ward two years ago
i know not sir
o she doth teach the torches to burn bright
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
like a rich jewel in an ethiopes ear
beauty too rich for use for earth too dear
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
as yonder lady oer her fellows shows
the measure done ill watch her place of stand
and touching hers make blessed my rude hand
did my heart love till now forswear it sight
for i neer saw true beauty till this night
this by his voice should be a montague
fetch me my rapier boy what dares the slave
come hither coverd with an antic face
to fleer and scorn at our solemnity
now by the stock and honour of my kin
to strike him dead i hold it not a sin
why how now kinsman wherefore storm you so
uncle this is a montague our foe
a villain that is hither come in spite
to scorn at our solemnity this night
young romeo is it
tis he that villain romeo
content thee gentle coz let him alone
he bears him like a portly gentleman
and to say truth verona brags of him
i would not for the wealth of all the town
it is my will the which if thou respect
show a fair presence and put off these frowns
and illbeseeming semblance for a feast
ill not endure him
am i the master here or you go to
youll not endure him god shall mend my soul
youll make a mutiny among my guests
you will set cockahoop youll be the man
why uncle tis a shame
go to go to
you must contrary me marry tis time
be quiet ormore light more light for shame
ill make you quiet what cheerly my hearts
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting
now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much
which mannerly devotion shows in this
for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch
and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss
have not saints lips and holy palmers too
ay pilgrim lips that they must use in prayer
o then dear saint let lips do what hands do
they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair
saints do not move though grant for prayers sake
then move not while my prayers effect i take
thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged
then have my lips the sin that they have took
sin from thy lips o trespass sweetly urged
give me my sin again
you kiss by the book
madam your mother craves a word with you
what is her mother
marry bachelor
her mother is the lady of the house
and a good lady and a wise and virtuous
i nursed her daughter that you talkd withal
i tell you he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks
is she a capulet
o dear account my life is my foes debt
away begone the sport is at the best
ay so i fear the more is my unrest
nay gentlemen prepare not to be gone
we have a trifling foolish banquet towards
is it een so why then i thank you all
i thank you honest gentlemen good night
more torches here come on then lets to bed
ill to my rest
come hither nurse what is yond gentleman
the son and heir of old tiberio
whats he that now is going out of door
marry that i think be young petrucio
whats he that follows there that would not dance
i know not
my grave is like to be my wedding bed
his name is romeo and a montague
the only son of your great enemy
my only love sprung from my only hate
too early seen unknown and known too late
prodigious birth of love it is to me
that i must love a loathed enemy
whats this whats this
a rhyme i learnd even now
of one i danced withal
anon anon
come lets away the strangers all are gone
now old desire doth in his deathbed lie
and young affection gapes to be his heir
that fair for which love groand for and would die
with tender juliet matchd is now not fair
now romeo is beloved and loves again
alike betwitched by the charm of looks
but to his foe supposed he must complain
being held a foe he may not have access
to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear
and she as much in love her means much less
but passion lends them power time means to meet
tempering extremities with extreme sweet
can i go forward when my heart is here
turn back dull earth and find thy centre out
romeo my cousin romeo
he is wise
and on my lie hath stoln him home to bed
call good mercutio
nay ill conjure too
romeo humours madman passion lover
speak but one rhyme and i am satisfied
cry but ay me pronounce but love and dove
speak to my gossip venus one fair word
one nickname for her purblind son and heir
young adam cupid he that shot so trim
when king cophetua loved the beggarmaid
he heareth not he stirreth not he moveth not
the ape is dead and i must conjure him
i conjure thee by rosalines bright eyes
by her high forehead and her scarlet lip
by her fine foot straight leg and quivering thigh
and the demesnes that there adjacent lie
that in thy likeness thou appear to us
and if he hear thee thou wilt anger him
to raise a spirit in his mistress circle
of some strange nature letting it there stand
till she had laid it and conjured it down
is fair and honest and in his mistress name
i conjure only but to raise up him
come he hath hid himself among these trees
blind is his love and best befits the dark
if love be blind love cannot hit the mark
now will he sit under a medlar tree
and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
as maids call medlars when they laugh alone
romeo that she were o that she were
an open et caetera thou a poperin pear
come shall we go
go then for tis in vain
to seek him here that means not to be found
he jests at scars that never felt a wound
but soft what light through yonder window breaks
it is the east and juliet is the sun
arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
who is already sick and pale with grief
be not her maid since she is envious
her vestal livery is but sick and green
and none but fools do wear it cast it off
it is my lady o it is my love
o that she knew she were
her eye discourses i will answer it
two of the fairest stars in all the heaven
having some business do entreat her eyes
to twinkle in their spheres till they return
what if her eyes were there they in her head
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven
would through the airy region stream so bright
that birds would sing and think it were not night
see how she leans her cheek upon her hand
o that i were a glove upon that hand
that i might touch that cheek
ay me
o speak again bright angel for thou art
as glorious to this night being oer my head
as is a winged messenger of heaven
unto the whiteupturned wondering eyes
of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
when he bestrides the lazypacing clouds
and sails upon the bosom of the air
o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo
deny thy father and refuse thy name
or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love
and ill no longer be a capulet
tis but thy name that is my enemy
thou art thyself though not a montague
whats montague it is nor hand nor foot
nor arm nor face nor any other part
belonging to a man o be some other name
whats in a name that which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet
so romeo would were he not romeo calld
retain that dear perfection which he owes
without that title romeo doff thy name
and for that name which is no part of thee
take all myself
call me but love and ill be new baptized
henceforth i never will be romeo
what man art thou that thus bescreend in night
so stumblest on my counsel
by a name
my name dear saint is hateful to myself
because it is an enemy to thee
had i it written i would tear the word
my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
art thou not romeo and a montague
neither fair saint if either thee dislike
how camest thou hither tell me and wherefore
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb
and the place death considering who thou art
if any of my kinsmen find thee here
with loves light wings did i oerperch these walls
for stony limits cannot hold love out
and what love can do that dares love attempt
therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me
if they do see thee they will murder thee
alack there lies more peril in thine eye
and i am proof against their enmity
i would not for the world they saw thee here
i have nights cloak to hide me from their sight
my life were better ended by their hate
than death prorogued wanting of thy love
by whose direction foundst thou out this place
by love who first did prompt me to inquire
he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes
i am no pilot yet wert thou as far
as that vast shore washd with the farthest sea
i would adventure for such merchandise
thou knowst the mask of night is on my face
else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny
dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay
thou mayst prove false at lovers perjuries
then say jove laughs o gentle romeo
or if thou thinkst i am too quickly won
ill frown and be perverse an say thee nay
so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
in truth fair montague i am too fond
but trust me gentleman ill prove more true
than those that have more cunning to be strange
i should have been more strange i must confess
but that thou overheardst ere i was ware
and not impute this yielding to light love
which the dark night hath so discovered
lady by yonder blessed moon i swear
that tips with silver all these fruittree tops
o swear not by the moon the inconstant moon
that monthly changes in her circled orb
lest that thy love prove likewise variable
what shall i swear by
do not swear at all
or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self
which is the god of my idolatry
and ill believe thee
if my hearts dear love
it is too rash too unadvised too sudden
too like the lightning which doth cease to be
ere one can say it lightens sweet good night
this bud of love by summers ripening breath
may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet
good night good night as sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart as that within my breast
o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight
the exchange of thy loves faithful vow for mine
and yet i would it were to give again
wouldst thou withdraw it for what purpose love
but to be frank and give it thee again
my bounty is as boundless as the sea
my love as deep the more i give to thee
the more i have for both are infinite
i hear some noise within dear love adieu
anon good nurse sweet montague be true
stay but a little i will come again
o blessed blessed night i am afeard
being in night all this is but a dream
too flatteringsweet to be substantial
three words dear romeo and good night indeed
if that thy bent of love be honourable
thy purpose marriage send me word tomorrow
by one that ill procure to come to thee
where and what time thou wilt perform the rite
and all my fortunes at thy foot ill lay
and follow thee my lord throughout the world
i come anonbut if thou meanst not well
i do beseech thee
tomorrow will i send
so thrive my soul
a thousand times good night
a thousand times the worse to want thy light
love goes toward love as schoolboys from
their books
but love from love toward school with heavy looks
hist romeo hist o for a falconers voice
to lure this tasselgentle back again
bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud
else would i tear the cave where echo lies
and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
with repetition of my romeos name
how silversweet sound lovers tongues by night
like softest music to attending ears
romeo
my dear
at what oclock tomorrow
shall i send to thee
at the hour of nine
i have forgot why i did call thee back
let me stand here till thou remember it
i shall forget to have thee still stand there
remembering how i love thy company
and ill still stay to have thee still forget
forgetting any other home but this
and yet no further than a wantons bird
who lets it hop a little from her hand
like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves
and with a silk thread plucks it back again
so lovingjealous of his liberty
i would i were thy bird
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing
good night good night parting is such
sweet sorrow
that i shall say good night till it be morrow
sleep dwell upon thine eyes peace in thy breast
would i were sleep and peace so sweet to rest
hence will i to my ghostly fathers cell
his help to crave and my dear hap to tell
the greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night
chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light
and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
now ere the sun advance his burning eye
the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry
i must upfill this osier cage of ours
with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
the earth thats natures mother is her tomb
what is her burying grave that is her womb
and from her womb children of divers kind
we sucking on her natural bosom find
many for many virtues excellent
none but for some and yet all different
o mickle is the powerful grace that lies
for nought so vile that on the earth doth live
but to the earth some special good doth give
nor aught so good but straind from that fair use
virtue itself turns vice being misapplied
and vice sometimes by action dignified
within the infant rind of this small flower
for this being smelt with that part cheers each part
being tasted slays all senses with the heart
two such opposed kings encamp them still
in man as well as herbs grace and rude will
and where the worser is predominant
full soon the canker death eats up that plant
good morrow father
benedicite
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me
young son it argues a distemperd head
care keeps his watch in every old mans eye
and where care lodges sleep will never lie
but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain
therefore thy earliness doth me assure
thou art uproused by some distemperature
or if not so then here i hit it right
our romeo hath not been in bed tonight
that last is true the sweeter rest was mine
god pardon sin wast thou with rosaline
with rosaline my ghostly father no
i have forgot that name and that names woe
ill tell thee ere thou ask it me again
i have been feasting with mine enemy
where on a sudden one hath wounded me
i bear no hatred blessed man for lo
my intercession likewise steads my foe
be plain good son and homely in thy drift
riddling confession finds but riddling shrift
then plainly know my hearts dear love is set
as mine on hers so hers is set on mine
and all combined save what thou must combine
we met we wood and made exchange of vow
ill tell thee as we pass but this i pray
that thou consent to marry us today
holy saint francis what a change is here
is rosaline whom thou didst love so dear
so soon forsaken young mens love then lies
not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
jesu maria what a deal of brine
hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline
how much salt water thrown away in waste
to season love that of it doth not taste
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears
thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears
lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
if eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine
and art thou changed pronounce this sentence then
women may fall when theres no strength in men
thou chidst me oft for loving rosaline
for doting not for loving pupil mine
and badst me bury love
not in a grave
to lay one in another out to have
i pray thee chide not she whom i love now
doth grace for grace and love for love allow
the other did not so
o she knew well
thy love did read by rote and could not spell
but come young waverer come go with me
in one respect ill thy assistant be
for this alliance may so happy prove
to turn your households rancour to pure love
o let us hence i stand on sudden haste
wisely and slow they stumble that run fast
where the devil should this romeo be
came he not home tonight
not to his fathers i spoke with his man
ah that same pale hardhearted wench that rosaline
torments him so that he will sure run mad
tybalt the kinsman of old capulet
hath sent a letter to his fathers house
a challenge on my life
romeo will answer it
any man that can write may answer a letter
nay he will answer the letters master how he
dares being dared
alas poor romeo he is already dead stabbed with a
white wenchs black eye shot through the ear with a
lovesong the very pin of his heart cleft with the
encounter tybalt
why what is tybalt
more than prince of cats i can tell you o he is
the courageous captain of compliments he fights as
you sing pricksong keeps time distance and
proportion rests me his minim rest one two and
button a duellist a duellist a gentleman of the
ah the immortal passado the punto reverso the

the pox of such antic lisping affecting
fantasticoes these new tuners of accents by jesu
a very good blade a very tall man a very good
whore why is not this a lamentable thing
grandsire that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies these fashionmongers these
perdonamis who stand so much on the new form
that they cannot at ease on the old bench o their
bones their bones
here comes romeo here comes romeo

romeo bon jour theres a french salutation
to your french slop you gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night
good morrow to you both what counterfeit did i give you
the ship sir the slip can you not conceive
pardon good mercutio my business was great and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy
thats as much as to say such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams
meaning to courtsy
thou hast most kindly hit it
a most courteous exposition
nay i am the very pink of courtesy
pink for flower
right
why then is my pump well flowered
worn out thy pump that when the single sole of it
is worn the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular
o singlesoled jest solely singular for the
singleness
come between us good benvolio my wits faint
switch and spurs switch and spurs or ill cry a match
nay if thy wits run the wildgoose chase i have
done for thou hast more of the wildgoose in one of
was i with you there for the goose
thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest
nay good goose bite not
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting it is a most
sharp sauce
and is it not well served in to a sweet goose
o heres a wit of cheveril that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad
i stretch it out for that word broad which added
to the goose proves thee far and wide a broad goose
why is not this better now than groaning for love
now art thou sociable now art thou romeo now art
for this drivelling love is like a great natural
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole
stop there stop there
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large
for i was come to the whole depth of my tale and
meant indeed to occupy the argument no longer
heres goodly gear

jacks and if i cannot ill find those that shall
scurvy knave i am none of his flirtgills i am

good quarrel and the law on my side

it of you and rosemary that it would do you good
to hear it
commend me to thy lady

peter
anon
peter take my fan and go before and apace
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse
in half an hour she promised to return
o she is lame loves heralds should be thoughts
which ten times faster glide than the suns beams
therefore do nimblepiniond doves draw love
and therefore hath the windswift cupid wings
now is the sun upon the highmost hill
of this days journey and from nine till twelve
is three long hours yet she is not come
had she affections and warm youthful blood
she would be as swift in motion as a ball
my words would bandy her to my sweet love
but old folks many feign as they were dead
unwieldy slow heavy and pale as lead
o god she comes
o honey nurse what news
hast thou met with him send thy man away
peter stay at the gate
now good sweet nurseo lord why lookst thou sad
though news be sad yet tell them merrily
if good thou shamest the music of sweet news
by playing it to me with so sour a face
fie how my bones ache what a jaunt have i had
nay come i pray thee speak good good nurse speak
jesu what haste can you not stay awhile
do you not see that i am out of breath
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
to say to me that thou art out of breath
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay
is longer than the tale thou dost excuse
is thy news good or bad answer to that
let me be satisfied ist good or bad
well you have made a simple choice you know not
face be better than any mans yet his leg excels
all mens and for a hand and a foot and a body
though they be not to be talked on yet they are
but ill warrant him as gentle as a lamb go thy
ways wench serve god what have you dined at home
what says he of our marriage what of that
lord how my head aches what a head have i
it beats as it would fall in twenty pieces
my back o t other sideo my back my back
beshrew your heart for sending me about
to catch my death with jaunting up and down
i faith i am sorry that thou art not well
sweet sweet sweet nurse tell me what says my love
your love says like an honest gentleman and a
courteous and a kind and a handsome and i
warrant a virtuouswhere is your mother
where is my mother why she is within
where should she be how oddly thou repliest
your love says like an honest gentleman
where is your mother
o gods lady dear
are you so hot marry come up i trow
is this the poultice for my aching bones
henceforward do your messages yourself
heres such a coil come what says romeo
have you got leave to go to shrift today
i have
then hie you hence to friar laurence cell
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks
theyll be in scarlet straight at any news
hie you to church i must another way
to fetch a ladder by the which your love
i am the drudge and toil in your delight
but you shall bear the burden soon at night
hie to high fortune honest nurse farewell
so smile the heavens upon this holy act
that after hours with sorrow chide us not
amen amen but come what sorrow can
it cannot countervail the exchange of joy
do thou but close our hands with holy words
then lovedevouring death do what he dare
it is enough i may but call her mine
these violent delights have violent ends
and in their triumph die like fire and powder
is loathsome in his own deliciousness
therefore love moderately long love doth so
too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
a lover may bestride the gossamer
that idles in the wanton summer air
and yet not fall so light is vanity
good even to my ghostly confessor
romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
as much to him else is his thanks too much
ah juliet if the measure of thy joy
be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more
to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath
this neighbour air and let rich musics tongue
unfold the imagined happiness that both
receive in either by this dear encounter
conceit more rich in matter than in words
they are but beggars that can count their worth
but my true love is grown to such excess
i cannot sum up sum of half my wealth
come come with me and we will make short work
for by your leaves you shall not stay alone
till holy church incorporate two in one
the day is hot the capulets abroad
and if we meet we shall not scape a brawl
for now these hot days is the mad blood stirring
thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says god send me no need of
thee and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer when indeed there is no need
am i like such a fellow
come come thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as
any in italy and as soon moved to be moody and as
soon moody to be moved
and what to
nay an there were two such we should have none
shortly for one would kill the other thou why
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts having no
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel
thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
man for coughing in the street because he hath
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before easter with another for
tying his new shoes with old riband and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art any man
should buy the feesimple of my life for an hour and a quarter
the feesimple o simple
by my head here come the capulets
by my heel i care not
follow me close for i will speak to them
and but one word with one of us couple it with
something make it a word and a blow
you shall find me apt enough to that sir an you
will give me occasion
could you not take some occasion without giving
mercutio thou consortst with romeo
consort what dost thou make us minstrels an
thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing but
make you dance zounds consort
either withdraw unto some private place
and reason coldly of your grievances
or else depart here all eyes gaze on us
mens eyes were made to look and let them gaze
i will not budge for no mans pleasure i
marry go before to field hell be your follower
your worship in that sense may call him man
romeo the hate i bear thee can afford
no better term than thisthou art a villain
tybalt the reason that i have to love thee
doth much excuse the appertaining rage
therefore farewell i see thou knowst me not
boy this shall not excuse the injuries
that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw
i do protest i never injured thee
but love thee better than thou canst devise
and so good capuletwhich name i tender
as dearly as my ownbe satisfied
o calm dishonourable vile submission
alla stoccata carries it away
tybalt you ratcatcher will you walk
what wouldst thou have with me
good king of cats nothing but one of your nine
lives that i mean to make bold withal and as you
shall use me hereafter drybeat the rest of the
eight will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears make haste lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out
i am for you
gentle mercutio put thy rapier up
come sir your passado
draw benvolio beat down their weapons
gentlemen for shame forbear this outrage
tybalt mercutio the prince expressly hath
hold tybalt good mercutio
i am hurt
a plague o both your houses i am sped
is he gone and hath nothing
what art thou hurt
ay ay a scratch a scratch marry tis enough
where is my page go villain fetch a surgeon
courage man the hurt cannot be much
no tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a
me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man i
am peppered i warrant for this world a plague o
both your houses zounds a dog a rat a mouse a
cat to scratch a man to death a braggart a
rogue a villain that fights by the book of
arithmetic why the devil came you between us i
was hurt under your arm
i thought all for the best
help me into some house benvolio
or i shall faint a plague o both your houses
this gentleman the princes near ally
my very friend hath got his mortal hurt
in my behalf my reputation staind
with tybalts slandertybalt that an hour
hath been my kinsman o sweet juliet
thy beauty hath made me effeminate
and in my temper softend valours steel
o romeo romeo brave mercutios dead
that gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds
which too untimely here did scorn the earth
this days black fate on more days doth depend
this but begins the woe others must end
here comes the furious tybalt back again
alive in triumph and mercutio slain
away to heaven respective lenity
and fireeyed fury be my conduct now
now tybalt take the villain back again
that late thou gavest me for mercutios soul
is but a little way above our heads
either thou or i or both must go with him
thou wretched boy that didst consort him here
shalt with him hence
this shall determine that
romeo away be gone
the citizens are up and tybalt slain
o i am fortunes fool
why dost thou stay
which way ran he that killd mercutio
tybalt that murderer which way ran he
there lies that tybalt
up sir go with me
i charge thee in the princes name obey
where are the vile beginners of this fray
o noble prince i can discover all
there lies the man slain by young romeo
that slew thy kinsman brave mercutio
tybalt my cousin o my brothers child
o prince o cousin husband o the blood is spilt
o my dear kinsman prince as thou art true
for blood of ours shed blood of montague
o cousin cousin
benvolio who began this bloody fray
tybalt here slain whom romeos hand did slay
romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink
how nice the quarrel was and urged withal
with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd
could not take truce with the unruly spleen
of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts
with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast
who all as hot turns deadly point to point
and with a martial scorn with one hand beats
cold death aside and with the other sends
it back to tybalt whose dexterity
hold friends friends part and swifter than
his tongue
his agile arm beats down their fatal points
and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm
an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life
of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled
but by and by comes back to romeo
who had but newly entertaind revenge
and to t they go like lightning for ere i
could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain
and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
this is the truth or let benvolio die
he is a kinsman to the montague
some twenty of them fought in this black strife
and all those twenty could but kill one life
i beg for justice which thou prince must give
romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live
romeo slew him he slew mercutio
who now the price of his dear blood doth owe
not romeo prince he was mercutios friend
his fault concludes but what the law should end
the life of tybalt
and for that offence
i have an interest in your hates proceeding
my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding
but ill amerce you with so strong a fine
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses
else when hes found that hour is his last
mercy but murders pardoning those that kill
gallop apace you fieryfooted steeds
as phaethon would whip you to the west
and bring in cloudy night immediately
spread thy close curtain loveperforming night
that runaways eyes may wink and romeo
leap to these arms untalkd of and unseen
lovers can see to do their amorous rites
by their own beauties or if love be blind
it best agrees with night come civil night
thou sobersuited matron all in black
and learn me how to lose a winning match
hood my unmannd blood bating in my cheeks
with thy black mantle till strange love grown bold
think true love acted simple modesty
come night come romeo come thou day in night
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
whiter than new snow on a ravens back
come gentle night come loving blackbrowd night
give me my romeo and when he shall die
take him and cut him out in little stars
and he will make the face of heaven so fine
that all the world will be in love with night
and pay no worship to the garish sun
o i have bought the mansion of a love
but not possessd it and though i am sold
as is the night before some festival
to an impatient child that hath new robes
and may not wear them o here comes my nurse
and she brings news and every tongue that speaks
but romeos name speaks heavenly eloquence
now nurse what news what hast thou there the cords
that romeo bid thee fetch
ay ay the cords
ay me what news why dost thou wring thy hands
ah welladay hes dead hes dead hes dead
we are undone lady we are undone
alack the day hes gone hes killd hes dead
can heaven be so envious
romeo can
who ever would have thought it romeo
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus
this torture should be roard in dismal hell
hath romeo slain himself say thou but i
and that bare vowel i shall poison more
i am not i if there be such an i
or those eyes shut that make thee answer i
brief sounds determine of my weal or woe
i saw the wound i saw it with mine eyes
a piteous corse a bloody piteous corse
pale pale as ashes all bedaubd in blood
all in goreblood i swounded at the sight
o break my heart poor bankrupt break at once
to prison eyes neer look on liberty
vile earth to earth resign end motion here
and thou and romeo press one heavy bier
o tybalt tybalt the best friend i had
o courteous tybalt honest gentleman
that ever i should live to see thee dead
what storm is this that blows so contrary
is romeo slaughterd and is tybalt dead
my dearloved cousin and my dearer lord
then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom
for who is living if those two are gone
tybalt is gone and romeo banished
romeo that killd him he is banished
o god did romeos hand shed tybalts blood
it did it did alas the day it did
o serpent heart hid with a flowering face
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave
beautiful tyrant fiend angelical
dovefeatherd raven wolvishravening lamb
despised substance of divinest show
just opposite to what thou justly seemst
a damned saint an honourable villain
o nature what hadst thou to do in hell
when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
in moral paradise of such sweet flesh
was ever book containing such vile matter
so fairly bound o that deceit should dwell
in such a gorgeous palace
theres no trust
no faith no honesty in men all perjured
all forsworn all naught all dissemblers
these griefs these woes these sorrows make me old
shame come to romeo
blisterd be thy tongue
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit
for tis a throne where honour may be crownd
sole monarch of the universal earth
o what a beast was i to chide at him
will you speak well of him that killd your cousin
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband
ah poor my lord what tongue shall smooth thy name
when i thy threehours wife have mangled it
but wherefore villain didst thou kill my cousin
back foolish tears back to your native spring
your tributary drops belong to woe
which you mistaking offer up to joy
my husband lives that tybalt would have slain
all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
some word there was worser than tybalts death
but o it presses to my memory
tybalt is dead and romeobanished
that banished that one word banished
hath slain ten thousand tybalts tybalts death
or if sour woe delights in fellowship
and needly will be rankd with other griefs
why followd not when she said tybalts dead
thy father or thy mother nay or both
which modern lamentations might have moved
but with a rearward following tybalts death
romeo is banished to speak that word
is father mother tybalt romeo juliet
all slain all dead romeo is banished
there is no end no limit measure bound
in that words death no words can that woe sound
where is my father and my mother nurse
will you go to them i will bring you thither
when theirs are dry for romeos banishment
he made you for a highway to my bed
but i a maid die maidenwidowed
come cords come nurse ill to my weddingbed
and death not romeo take my maidenhead
ill to him he is hid at laurence cell
o find him give this ring to my true knight
and bid him come to take his last farewell
affliction is enamourd of thy parts
and thou art wedded to calamity
father what news what is the princes doom
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
that i yet know not
too familiar
i bring thee tidings of the princes doom
what less than doomsday is the princes doom
a gentler judgment vanishd from his lips
not bodys death but bodys banishment
ha banishment be merciful say death
for exile hath more terror in his look
be patient for the world is broad and wide
there is no world without verona walls
but purgatory torture hell itself
hencebanished is banishd from the world
thou cuttst my head off with a golden axe
and smilest upon the stroke that murders me
o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness
thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince
taking thy part hath rushd aside the law
this is dear mercy and thou seest it not
where juliet lives and every cat and dog
and little mouse every unworthy thing
live here in heaven and may look on her
more honourable state more courtship lives
on the white wonder of dear juliets hand
and steal immortal blessing from her lips
who even in pure and vestal modesty
still blush as thinking their own kisses sin
they are free men but i am banished
and sayst thou yet that exile is not death
hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife
no sudden mean of death though neer so mean
but banished to kill mebanished
o friar the damned use that word in hell
being a divine a ghostly confessor
a sinabsolver and my friend professd
to mangle me with that word banished
thou fond mad man hear me but speak a word
o thou wilt speak again of banishment
adversitys sweet milk philosophy
to comfort thee though thou art banished
yet banished hang up philosophy
unless philosophy can make a juliet
displant a town reverse a princes doom
o then i see that madmen have no ears
how should they when that wise men have no eyes
let me dispute with thee of thy estate
wert thou as young as i juliet thy love
an hour but married tybalt murdered
doting like me and like me banished
then mightst thou speak then mightst thou tear thy hair
and fall upon the ground as i do now
taking the measure of an unmade grave
arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself
not i unless the breath of heartsick groans
mistlike infold me from the search of eyes
hark how they knock whos there romeo arise
thou wilt be taken stay awhile stand up
run to my study by and by gods will
what simpleness is this i come i come
who knocks so hard whence come you whats your will
welcome then
o holy friar o tell me holy friar
where is my ladys lord wheres romeo
there on the ground with his own tears made drunk
o he is even in my mistress case
just in her case o woful sympathy
piteous predicament even so lies she
blubbering and weeping weeping and blubbering
for juliets sake for her sake rise and stand
why should you fall into so deep an o
nurse
ah sir ah sir well deaths the end of all
spakest thou of juliet how is it with her
doth she not think me an old murderer
now i have staind the childhood of our joy
with blood removed but little from her own
where is she and how doth she and what says
my conceald lady to our cancelld love
o she says nothing sir but weeps and weeps
and now falls on her bed and then starts up
and tybalt calls and then on romeo cries
and then down falls again
as if that name
shot from the deadly level of a gun
did murder her as that names cursed hand
murderd her kinsman o tell me friar tell me
in what vile part of this anatomy
doth my name lodge tell me that i may sack
the hateful mansion
thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote
unseemly woman in a seeming man
or illbeseeming beast in seeming both
i thought thy disposition better temperd
hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself
and stay thy lady too that lives in thee
by doing damned hate upon thyself
why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet
in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit
which like a usurer aboundst in all
and usest none in that true use indeed
thy noble shape is but a form of wax
digressing from the valour of a man
thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury
killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish
thy wit that ornament to shape and love
misshapen in the conduct of them both
like powder in a skitless soldiers flask
is set afire by thine own ignorance
and thou dismemberd with thine own defence
what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive
for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
the law that threatend death becomes thy friend
a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back
happiness courts thee in her best array
but like a misbehaved and sullen wench
take heed take heed for such die miserable
go get thee to thy love as was decreed
but look thou stay not till the watch be set
for then thou canst not pass to mantua
where thou shalt live till we can find a time
to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends
beg pardon of the prince and call thee back
with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
than thou wentst forth in lamentation
and bid her hasten all the house to bed
romeo is coming
o lord i could have stayd here all the night
my lord ill tell my lady you will come
do so and bid my sweet prepare to chide
hie you make haste for it grows very late
how well my comfort is revived by this
either be gone before the watch be set
sojourn in mantua ill find out your man
and he shall signify from time to time
but that a joy past joy calls out on me
things have falln out sir so unluckily
look you she loved her kinsman tybalt dearly
i promise you but for your company
i would have been abed an hour ago
these times of woe afford no time to woo
i will and know her mind early tomorrow
tonight she is mewd up to her heaviness
sir paris i will make a desperate tender
in all respects by me nay more i doubt it not
wife go you to her ere you go to bed
acquaint her here of my son paris love
and bid her mark you me on wednesday next
but soft what day is this

monday ha ha well wednesday is too soon
she shall be married to this noble earl
will you be ready do you like this haste

it may be thought we held him carelessly
therefore well have some half a dozen friends
and there an end but what say you to thursday
my lord i would that thursday were tomorrow
go you to juliet ere you go to bed
prepare her wife against this weddingday
farewell my lord light to my chamber ho
afore me it is so very very late
that we may call it early by and by
good night
it was the nightingale and not the lark
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear
believe me love it was the nightingale
it was the lark the herald of the morn
nights candles are burnt out and jocund day
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops
i must be gone and live or stay and die
it is some meteor that the sun exhales
to be to thee this night a torchbearer
therefore stay yet thou needst not to be gone
let me be taen let me be put to death
i am content so thou wilt have it so
ill say yon grey is not the mornings eye
tis but the pale reflex of cynthias brow
nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
come death and welcome juliet wills it so
how ist my soul lets talk it is not day
it is the lark that sings so out of tune
straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps
some say the lark makes sweet division
some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes
o now i would they had changed voices too
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray
hunting thee hence with huntsup to the day
o now be gone more light and light it grows
more light and light more dark and dark our woes
madam
nurse
the day is broke be wary look about
then window let day in and let life out
farewell farewell one kiss and ill descend
art thou gone so love lord ay husband friend
i must hear from thee every day in the hour
o by this count i shall be much in years
ere i again behold my romeo
farewell
i will omit no opportunity
that may convey my greetings love to thee
o thinkst thou we shall ever meet again
i doubt it not and all these woes shall serve
for sweet discourses in our time to come
o god i have an illdivining soul
methinks i see thee now thou art below
either my eyesight fails or thou lookst pale
dry sorrow drinks our blood adieu adieu
if thou art fickle what dost thou with him
that is renownd for faith be fickle fortune
for then i hope thou wilt not keep him long
but send him back
who ist that calls is it my lady mother
is she not down so late or up so early
what unaccustomd cause procures her hither
why how now juliet
madam i am not well
evermore weeping for your cousins death
what wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears
an if thou couldst thou couldst not make him live
but much of grief shows still some want of wit
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss
so shall you feel the loss but not the friend
which you weep for
feeling so the loss
cannot choose but ever weep the friend
well girl thou weepst not so much for his death
as that the villain lives which slaughterd him
what villain madam
that same villain romeo
that is because the traitor murderer lives
would none but i might venge my cousins death
then weep no more ill send to one in mantua
where that same banishd runagate doth live
shall give him such an unaccustomd dram
and then i hope thou wilt be satisfied
indeed i never shall be satisfied
with romeo till i behold himdead
is my poor heart for a kinsman vexd
madam if you could find out but a man
to bear a poison i would temper it
that romeo should upon receipt thereof
soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors
to hear him named and cannot come to him
to wreak the love i bore my cousin
upon his body that slaughterd him
find thou the means and ill find such a man
but now ill tell thee joyful tidings girl
what are they i beseech your ladyship
well well thou hast a careful father child
one who to put thee from thy heaviness
hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
that thou expectst not nor i lookd not for
madam in happy time what day is that
marry my child early next thursday morn
the gallant young and noble gentleman
the county paris at saint peters church
shall happily make thee there a joyful bride
now by saint peters church and peter too
he shall not make me there a joyful bride
i wonder at this haste that i must wed
ere he that should be husband comes to woo
i pray you tell my lord and father madam
i will not marry yet and when i do i swear
it shall be romeo whom you know i hate
rather than paris these are news indeed
here comes your father tell him so yourself
and see how he will take it at your hands
when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew
but for the sunset of my brothers son
it rains downright
how now a conduit girl what still in tears
evermore showering in one little body
thou counterfeitst a bark a sea a wind
for still thy eyes which i may call the sea
do ebb and flow with tears the bark thy body is
sailing in this salt flood the winds thy sighs
who raging with thy tears and they with them
without a sudden calm will overset
thy tempesttossed body how now wife
have you deliverd to her our decree
ay sir but she will none she gives you thanks
i would the fool were married to her grave
soft take me with you take me with you wife
how will she none doth she not give us thanks
is she not proud doth she not count her blest
unworthy as she is that we have wrought
so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom
proud can i never be of what i hate
but thankful even for hate that is meant love
how now how now choplogic what is this
proud and i thank you and i thank you not
and yet not proud mistress minion you
thank me no thankings nor proud me no prouds
but fettle your fine joints gainst thursday next
to go with paris to saint peters church
or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither
out you greensickness carrion out you baggage
you tallowface
fie fie what are you mad
good father i beseech you on my knees
hear me with patience but to speak a word
hang thee young baggage disobedient wretch
speak not reply not do not answer me
my fingers itch wife we scarce thought us blest
that god had lent us but this only child
but now i see this one is one too much
out on her hilding
god in heaven bless her
you are to blame my lord to rate her so
and why my lady wisdom hold your tongue
good prudence smatter with your gossips go
i speak no treason
o god ye godden
may not one speak
peace you mumbling fool
utter your gravity oer a gossips bowl
for here we need it not
you are too hot
day night hour tide time work play
alone in company still my care hath been
a gentleman of noble parentage
of fair demesnes youthful and nobly traind
stuffd as they say with honourable parts
proportiond as ones thought would wish a man
and then to have a wretched puling fool
a whining mammet in her fortunes tender
to answer ill not wed i cannot love
i am too young i pray you pardon me
look tot think ont i do not use to jest
an you be mine ill give you to my friend
and you be not hang beg starve die in
the streets
for by my soul ill neer acknowledge thee
trust tot bethink you ill not be forsworn
is there no pity sitting in the clouds
that sees into the bottom of my grief
o sweet my mother cast me not away
delay this marriage for a month a week
or if you do not make the bridal bed
in that dim monument where tybalt lies
do as thou wilt for i have done with thee
o godo nurse how shall this be prevented
my husband is on earth my faith in heaven
how shall that faith return again to earth
unless that husband send it me from heaven
by leaving earth comfort me counsel me
alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems
upon so soft a subject as myself
what sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy
some comfort nurse
faith here it is
romeo is banishd and all the world to nothing
that he dares neer come back to challenge you
or if he do it needs must be by stealth
then since the case so stands as now it doth
i think it best you married with the county
o hes a lovely gentleman
hath not so green so quick so fair an eye
as paris hath beshrew my very heart
i think you are happy in this second match
your first is dead or twere as good he were
as living here and you no use of him
speakest thou from thy heart
and from my soul too
or else beshrew them both
amen
what
well thou hast comforted me marvellous much
having displeased my father to laurence cell
to make confession and to be absolved
marry i will and this is wisely done
ancient damnation o most wicked fiend
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn
or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
which she hath praised him with above compare
so many thousand times go counsellor
thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain
if all else fail myself have power to die
on thursday sir the time is very short
my father capulet will have it so
and i am nothing slow to slack his haste
uneven is the course i like it not
immoderately she weeps for tybalts death
and therefore have i little talkd of love
for venus smiles not in a house of tears
now sir her father counts it dangerous
that she doth give her sorrow so much sway
and in his wisdom hastes our marriage
to stop the inundation of her tears
which too much minded by herself alone
now do you know the reason of this haste
happily met my lady and my wife
that may be sir when i may be a wife
that may be must be love on thursday next
what must be shall be
thats a certain text
come you to make confession to this father
to answer that i should confess to you
do not deny to him that you love me
i will confess to you that i love him
so will ye i am sure that you love me
if i do so it will be of more price
being spoke behind your back than to your face
poor soul thy face is much abused with tears
the tears have got small victory by that
for it was bad enough before their spite
thou wrongst it more than tears with that report
that is no slander sir which is a truth
and what i spake i spake it to my face
thy face is mine and thou hast slanderd it
it may be so for it is not mine own
are you at leisure holy father now
or shall i come to you at evening mass
my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
my lord we must entreat the time alone
god shield i should disturb devotion
till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
o shut the door and when thou hast done so
come weep with me past hope past cure past help
ah juliet i already know thy grief
i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it
on thursday next be married to this county
tell me not friar that thou hearst of this
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help
do thou but call my resolution wise
and with this knife ill help it presently
god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands
and ere this hand by thee to romeo seald
shall be the label to another deed
or my true heart with treacherous revolt
therefore out of thy longexperienced time
give me some present counsel or behold
twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
shall play the umpire arbitrating that
which the commission of thy years and art
could to no issue of true honour bring
be not so long to speak i long to die
if what thou speakst speak not of remedy
which craves as desperate an execution
as that is desperate which we would prevent
if rather than to marry county paris
thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself
then is it likely thou wilt undertake
a thing like death to chide away this shame
and if thou darest ill give thee remedy
o bid me leap rather than marry paris
from off the battlements of yonder tower
or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk
where serpents are chain me with roaring bears
or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse
oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones
with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls
or bid me go into a newmade grave
and hide me with a dead man in his shroud
things that to hear them told have made me tremble
and i will do it without fear or doubt
to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love
hold then go home be merry give consent
tomorrow night look that thou lie alone
take thou this vial being then in bed
and this distilled liquor drink thou off
when presently through all thy veins shall run
a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse
no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest
the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall
like death when he shuts up the day of life
each part deprived of supple government
and in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death
thou shalt continue two and forty hours
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
then as the manner of our country is
in thy best robes uncoverd on the bier
thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
where all the kindred of the capulets lie
in the mean time against thou shalt awake
shall romeo by my letters know our drift
will watch thy waking and that very night
shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
and this shall free thee from this present shame
if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
abate thy valour in the acting it
give me give me o tell not me of fear
hold get you gone be strong and prosperous
to mantua with my letters to thy lord
love give me strength and strength shall help afford
farewell dear father
so many guests invite as here are writ
sirrah go hire me twenty cunning cooks
you shall have none ill sir for ill try if they
can lick their fingers
how canst thou try them so
marry sir tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
fingers goes not with me
go be gone
we shall be much unfurnished for this time
what is my daughter gone to friar laurence
ay forsooth
a peevish selfwilld harlotry it is
see where she comes from shrift with merry look
how now my headstrong where have you been gadding
where i have learnd me to repent the sin
of disobedient opposition
to you and your behests and am enjoind
by holy laurence to fall prostrate here
henceforward i am ever ruled by you
ill have this knot knit up tomorrow morning
i met the youthful lord at laurence cell
and gave him what becomed love i might
not step oer the bounds of modesty
this is ast should be let me see the county
ay marry go i say and fetch him hither
now afore god this reverend holy friar
our whole city is much bound to him
nurse will you go with me into my closet
to help me sort such needful ornaments
as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow
no not till thursday there is time enough
tis now near night
tush i will stir about
go thou to juliet help to deck up her
ill not to bed tonight let me alone
ill play the housewife for this once what ho
they are all forth well i will walk myself
to county paris to prepare him up
since this same wayward girl is so reclaimd
i pray thee leave me to myself tonight
for i have need of many orisons
to move the heavens to smile upon my state
which well thou knowst is cross and full of sin
what are you busy ho need you my help
no madam we have culld such necessaries
so please you let me now be left alone
and let the nurse this night sit up with you
for i am sure you have your hands full all
in this so sudden business
get thee to bed and rest for thou hast need
farewell god knows when we shall meet again
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
nurse what should she do here
my dismal scene i needs must act alone
come vial
what if this mixture do not work at all
shall i be married then tomorrow morning
what if it be a poison which the friar
subtly hath ministerd to have me dead
lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd
because he married me before to romeo
for he hath still been tried a holy man
how if when i am laid into the tomb
i wake before the time that romeo
come to redeem me theres a fearful point
shall i not then be stifled in the vault
to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in
and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
or if i live is it not very like
the horrible conceit of death and night
together with the terror of the place
as in a vault an ancient receptacle
where for these many hundred years the bones
where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth
lies festering in his shroud where as they say
at some hours in the night spirits resort
alack alack is it not like that i
so early waking what with loathsome smells
and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth
o if i wake shall i not be distraught
environed with all these hideous fears
and madly play with my forefathers joints
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone
as with a club dash out my desperate brains
o look methinks i see my cousins ghost
seeking out romeo that did spit his body
romeo i come this do i drink to thee
hold take these keys and fetch more spices nurse
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry
come stir stir stir the second cock hath crowd

ties up my tongue and will not let me speak
come is the bride ready to go to church
ready to go but never to return

death is my soninlaw death is my heir
and leave him all life living all is deaths
have i thought long to see this mornings face
and doth it give me such a sight as this
accursed unhappy wretched hateful day
most miserable hour that eer time saw
in lasting labour of his pilgrimage
but one poor one one poor and loving child
but one thing to rejoice and solace in
and cruel death hath catchd it from my sight
o woe o woful woful woful day

and with my child my joys are buried
peace ho for shame confusions cure lives not
in these confusions heaven and yourself
had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all
your part in her you could not keep from death
but heaven keeps his part in eternal life
the most you sought was her promotion
and weep ye now seeing she is advanced
above the clouds as high as heaven itself
o in this love you love your child so ill
shes not well married that lives married long
but shes best married that dies married young
dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
on this fair corse and as the custom is
for though fond nature bids us an lament
yet natures tears are reasons merriment
all things that we ordained festival
turn from their office to black funeral
our instruments to melancholy bells
our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast
our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change
our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse
and all things change them to the contrary
sir go you in and madam go with him
and go sir paris every one prepare
the heavens do lour upon you for some ill
move them no more by crossing their high will
faith we may put up our pipes and be gone
honest goodfellows ah put up put up
for well you know this is a pitiful case
ay by my troth the case may be amended
musicians o musicians hearts ease hearts
why hearts ease
o musicians because my heart itself plays my
to comfort me

you will not then

ill fa you do you note me

pray you put up your dagger and put out your wit
then have at you with my wit i will drybeat you
with an iron wit and put up my iron dagger answer
when griping grief the heart doth wound
and doleful dumps the mind oppress
then music with her silver sound
why silver sound why music with her silver
sound what say you simon catling
marry sir because silver hath a sweet sound
pretty what say you hugh rebeck
i say silver sound because musicians sound for silver
pretty too what say you james soundpost
faith i know not what to say
for you it is music with her silver sound
then music with her silver sound
with speedy help doth lend redress
what a pestilent knave is this same
hang him jack come well in here tarry for the
mourners and stay dinner
if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep
my bosoms lord sits lightly in his throne
and all this day an unaccustomd spirit
lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead
strange dream that gives a dead man leave
to think
and breathed such life with kisses in my lips
that i revived and was an emperor
ah me how sweet is love itself possessd
when but loves shadows are so rich in joy
news from veronahow now balthasar
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar
how doth my lady is my father well
how fares my juliet that i ask again
for nothing can be ill if she be well
her body sleeps in capels monument
and her immortal part with angels lives
i saw her laid low in her kindreds vault
o pardon me for bringing these ill news
since you did leave it for my office sir
is it even so then i defy you stars
and hire posthorses i will hence tonight
your looks are pale and wild and do import
some misadventure
leave me and do the thing i bid thee do
hast thou no letters to me from the friar
no my good lord
and hire those horses ill be with thee straight
well juliet i will lie with thee tonight
to enter in the thoughts of desperate men
i do remember an apothecary
and hereabouts he dwellswhich late i noted
in tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows
culling of simples meagre were his looks
and in his needy shop a tortoise hung
an alligator stuffd and other skins
of illshaped fishes and about his shelves
a beggarly account of empty boxes
green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds
remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses
were thinly scatterd to make up a show
noting this penury to myself i said
an if a man did need a poison now
whose sale is present death in mantua
here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
o this same thought did but forerun my need
and this same needy man must sell it me
as i remember this should be the house
being holiday the beggars shop is shut
what ho apothecary
who calls so loud
a dram of poison such soonspeeding gear
as will disperse itself through all the veins
that the lifeweary taker may fall dead
and that the trunk may be discharged of breath
as violently as hasty powder fired
doth hurry from the fatal cannons womb
such mortal drugs i have but mantuas law
is death to any he that utters them
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
and fearst to die famine is in thy cheeks
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes
contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back
the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law
the world affords no law to make thee rich
then be not poor but break it and take this
my poverty but not my will consents
i pay thy poverty and not thy will
put this in any liquid thing you will
and drink it off and if you had the strength
of twenty men it would dispatch you straight
there is thy gold worse poison to mens souls
doing more murders in this loathsome world
than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell
i sell thee poison thou hast sold me none
come cordial and not poison go with me
to juliets grave for there must i use thee
holy franciscan friar brother ho
this same should be the voice of friar john
or if his mind be writ give me his letter
going to find a barefoot brother out
one of our order to associate me
here in this city visiting the sick
and finding him the searchers of the town
suspecting that we both were in a house
where the infectious pestilence did reign
seald up the doors and would not let us forth
so that my speed to mantua there was stayd
who bare my letter then to romeo
i could not send ithere it is again
nor get a messenger to bring it thee
so fearful were they of infection
unhappy fortune by my brotherhood
the letter was not nice but full of charge
of dear import and the neglecting it
may do much danger friar john go hence
get me an iron crow and bring it straight
unto my cell
brother ill go and bring it thee
now must i to the monument alone
she will beshrew me much that romeo
hath had no notice of these accidents
but i will write again to mantua
and keep her at my cell till romeo come
poor living corse closed in a dead mans tomb
yet put it out for i would not be seen
under yond yewtrees lay thee all along
holding thine ear close to the hollow ground
so shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
being loose unfirm with digging up of graves
as signal that thou hearst something approach
give me those flowers do as i bid thee go
sweet flower with flowers thy bridal bed i strew
o woe thy canopy is dust and stones
which with sweet water nightly i will dew
the obsequies that i for thee will keep
nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep
the boy gives warning something doth approach
what cursed foot wanders this way tonight
to cross my obsequies and true loves rite
what with a torch muffle me night awhile
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron
hold take this letter early in the morning
see thou deliver it to my lord and father
whateer thou hearst or seest stand all aloof
and do not interrupt me in my course
why i descend into this bed of death
is partly to behold my ladys face
but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
a precious ring a ring that i must use
but if thou jealous dost return to pry
in what i further shall intend to do
by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint
the time and my intents are savagewild
more fierce and more inexorable far
than empty tigers or the roaring sea
i will be gone sir and not trouble you
thou detestable maw thou womb of death
gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth
thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open
and in despite ill cram thee with more food
this is that banishd haughty montague
that murderd my loves cousin with which grief
it is supposed the fair creature died
and here is come to do some villanous shame
stop thy unhallowd toil vile montague
can vengeance be pursued further than death
obey and go with me for thou must die
i must indeed and therefore came i hither
good gentle youth tempt not a desperate man
let them affright thee i beseech thee youth
put not another sin upon my head
by heaven i love thee better than myself
stay not be gone live and hereafter say
a madmans mercy bade thee run away
i do defy thy conjurations
and apprehend thee for a felon here
wilt thou provoke me then have at thee boy
o lord they fight i will go call the watch
o i am slain
if thou be merciful
open the tomb lay me with juliet
in faith i will let me peruse this face
mercutios kinsman noble county paris
what said my man when my betossed soul
did not attend him as we rode i think
said he not so or did i dream it so
or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet
to think it was so o give me thy hand
one writ with me in sour misfortunes book
ill bury thee in a triumphant grave
a grave o no a lantern slaughterd youth
for here lies juliet and her beauty makes
this vault a feasting presence full of light
death lie thou there by a dead man interrd
how oft when men are at the point of death
have they been merry which their keepers call
call this a lightning o my love my wife
death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath
thou art not conquerd beautys ensign yet
is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks
and deaths pale flag is not advanced there
tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
o what more favour can i do to thee
than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
to sunder his that was thine enemy
forgive me cousin ah dear juliet
why art thou yet so fair shall i believe
that unsubstantial death is amorous
and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
thee here in dark to be his paramour
for fear of that i still will stay with thee
and never from this palace of dim night
with worms that are thy chambermaids o here
will i set up my everlasting rest
and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
from this worldwearied flesh eyes look your last
arms take your last embrace and lips o you
the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss
a dateless bargain to engrossing death
come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide
thou desperate pilot now at once run on
the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark
heres to my love
o true apothecary
thy drugs are quick thus with a kiss i die
saint francis be my speed how oft tonight
have my old feet stumbled at graves whos there
heres one a friend and one that knows you well
bliss be upon you tell me good my friend
what torch is yond that vainly lends his light
to grubs and eyeless skulls as i discern
it burneth in the capels monument
it doth so holy sir and theres my master
one that you love
who is it
romeo
how long hath he been there
full half an hour
go with me to the vault
i dare not sir
my master knows not but i am gone hence
and fearfully did menace me with death
if i did stay to look on his intents
o much i fear some ill unlucky thing
as i did sleep under this yewtree here
i dreamt my master and another fought
and that my master slew him
romeo
alack alack what blood is this which stains
the stony entrance of this sepulchre
what mean these masterless and gory swords
to lie discolourd by this place of peace
romeo o pale who else what paris too
and steepd in blood ah what an unkind hour
is guilty of this lamentable chance
the lady stirs
o comfortable friar where is my lord
i do remember well where i should be
and there i am where is my romeo
i hear some noise lady come from that nest
a greater power than we can contradict
hath thwarted our intents come come away
thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead
and paris too come ill dispose of thee
stay not to question for the watch is coming
come go good juliet
i dare no longer stay
go get thee hence for i will not away
whats here a cup closed in my true loves hand
o churl drunk all and left no friendly drop
to help me after i will kiss thy lips
haply some poison yet doth hang on them
to make die with a restorative
thy lips are warm
yea noise then ill be brief o happy dagger
this is thy sheath
there rust and let me die
this is the place there where the torch doth burn
go some of you whoeer you find attach
pitiful sight here lies the county slain
and juliet bleeding warm and newly dead
who here hath lain these two days buried
we see the ground whereon these woes do lie
but the true ground of all these piteous woes
we cannot without circumstance descry
heres romeos man we found him in the churchyard
hold him in safety till the prince come hither
we took this mattock and this spade from him
as he was coming from this churchyard side
what misadventure is so early up
that calls our person from our mornings rest
what should it be that they so shriek abroad
the people in the street cry romeo
some juliet and some paris and all run
with open outcry toward our monument
what fear is this which startles in our ears
sovereign here lies the county paris slain
and romeo dead and juliet dead before
warm and new killd
search seek and know how this foul murder comes
here is a friar and slaughterd romeos man
with instruments upon them fit to open
these dead mens tombs
o heavens o wife look how our daughter bleeds
this dagger hath mistaenfor lo his house
is empty on the back of montague
and it missheathed in my daughters bosom
o me this sight of death is as a bell
that warns my old age to a sepulchre
come montague for thou art early up
to see thy son and heir more early down
alas my liege my wife is dead tonight
what further woe conspires against mine age
look and thou shalt see
o thou untaught what manners is in this
to press before thy father to a grave
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while
till we can clear these ambiguities
and know their spring their head their
true descent
and then will i be general of your woes
and let mischance be slave to patience
bring forth the parties of suspicion
i am the greatest able to do least
yet most suspected as the time and place
doth make against me of this direful murder
and here i stand both to impeach and purge
myself condemned and myself excused
then say at once what thou dost know in this
i will be brief for my short date of breath
is not so long as is a tedious tale
romeo there dead was husband to that juliet
i married them and their stoln marriageday
was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death
banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city
for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined
you to remove that siege of grief from her
betrothd and would have married her perforce
and with wild looks bid me devise some mean
to rid her from this second marriage
or in my cell there would she kill herself
then gave i her so tutord by my art
a sleeping potion which so took effect
as i intended for it wrought on her
that he should hither come as this dire night
to help to take her from her borrowd grave
being the time the potions force should cease
but he which bore my letter friar john
was stayd by accident and yesternight
returnd my letter back then all alone
at the prefixed hour of her waking
came i to take her from her kindreds vault
meaning to keep her closely at my cell
but when i came some minute ere the time
of her awaking here untimely lay
the noble paris and true romeo dead
she wakes and i entreated her come forth
but then a noise did scare me from the tomb
and she too desperate would not go with me
but as it seems did violence on herself
all this i know and to the marriage
miscarried by my fault let my old life
be sacrificed some hour before his time
unto the rigour of severest law
we still have known thee for a holy man
wheres romeos man what can he say in this
i brought my master news of juliets death
and then in post he came from mantua
to this same place to this same monument
this letter he early bid me give his father
and threatened me with death going in the vault
i departed not and left him there
give me the letter i will look on it
where is the countys page that raised the watch
sirrah what made your master in this place
he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb
and by and by my master drew on him
and then i ran away to call the watch
this letter doth make good the friars words
and here he writes that he did buy a poison
of a poor pothecary and therewithal
came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
where be these enemies capulet montague
see what a scourge is laid upon your hate
that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love
and i for winking at your discords too
this is my daughters jointure for no more
can i demand
for i will raise her statue in pure gold
that while verona by that name is known
there shall no figure at such rate be set
as that of true and faithful juliet
as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie
poor sacrifices of our enmity
a glooming peace this morning with it brings
go hence to have more talk of these sad things
for never was a story of more woe
than this of juliet and her romeo
i wonder how the king escaped our hands
while we pursued the horsemen of the north
whereat the great lord of northumberland
whose warlike ears could never brook retreat
cheerd up the drooping army and himself
lord clifford and lord stafford all abreast
charged our main battles front and breaking in
were by the swords of common soldiers slain
lord staffords father duke of buckingham
is either slain or wounded dangerously
that this is true father behold his blood
and brother heres the earl of wiltshires blood
whom i encounterd as the battles joind
speak thou for me and tell them what i did
richard hath best deserved of all my sons
but is your grace dead my lord of somerset
such hope have all the line of john of gaunt
thus do i hope to shake king henrys head
and so do i victorious prince of york
before i see thee seated in that throne
which now the house of lancaster usurps
i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close
this is the palace of the fearful king
for this is thine and not king henrys heirs
assist me then sweet warwick and i will
for hither we have broken in by force
well all assist you he that flies shall die
and soldiers stay and lodge by me this night
and when the king comes offer no violence
unless he seek to thrust you out perforce
the queen this day here holds her parliament
by words or blows here let us win our right
armd as we are lets stay within this house
the bloody parliament shall this be calld
unless plantagenet duke of york be king
and bashful henry deposed whose cowardice
hath made us bywords to our enemies
then leave me not my lords be resolute
i mean to take possession of my right
neither the king nor he that loves him best
the proudest he that holds up lancaster
dares stir a wing if warwick shake his bells
resolve thee richard claim the english crown
my lords look where the sturdy rebel sits
backd by the power of warwick that false peer
to aspire unto the crown and reign as king
earl of northumberland he slew thy father
and thine lord clifford and you both have vowd revenge
on him his sons his favourites and his friends
if i be not heavens be revenged on me
the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel
my heart for anger burns i cannot brook it
be patient gentle earl of westmoreland
he durst not sit there had your father lived
my gracious lord here in the parliament
let us assail the family of york
ah know you not the city favours them
and they have troops of soldiers at their beck
but when the duke is slain theyll quickly fly
far be the thought of this from henrys heart
to make a shambles of the parliamenthouse
cousin of exeter frowns words and threats
shall be the war that henry means to use
thou factious duke of york descend my throne
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet
i am thy sovereign
i am thine
twas my inheritance as the earldom was
thy father was a traitor to the crown
exeter thou art a traitor to the crown
in following this usurping henry
whom should he follow but his natural king
true clifford and thats richard duke of york
and shall i stand and thou sit in my throne
be duke of lancaster let him be king
he is both king and duke of lancaster
and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain
and warwick shall disprove it you forget
that we are those which chased you from the field
and slew your fathers and with colours spread
marchd through the city to the palace gates
yes warwick i remember it to my grief
and by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it
plantagenet of thee and these thy sons
thy kinsman and thy friends ill have more lives
than drops of blood were in my fathers veins
urge it no more lest that instead of words
i send thee warwick such a messenger
as shall revenge his death before i stir
poor clifford how i scorn his worthless threats
will you we show our title to the crown
if not our swords shall plead it in the field
what title hast thou traitor to the crown
thy father was as thou art duke of york
i am the son of henry the fifth
who made the dauphin and the french to stoop
and seized upon their towns and provinces
talk not of france sith thou hast lost it all
when i was crownd i was but nine months old
you are old enough now and yet methinks you lose
father tear the crown from the usurpers head
sweet father do so set it on your head
good brother as thou lovest and honourest arms
lets fight it out and not stand cavilling thus
sound drums and trumpets and the king will fly
sons peace
peace thou and give king henry leave to speak
and be you silent and attentive too
for he that interrupts him shall not live
thinkst thou that i will leave my kingly throne
wherein my grandsire and my father sat
ay and their colours often borne in france
and now in england to our hearts great sorrow
shall be my windingsheet why faint you lords
my titles good and better far than his
prove it henry and thou shalt be king
henry the fourth by conquest got the crown
twas by rebellion against his king
what then
an if he may then am i lawful king
for richard in the view of many lords
resignd the crown to henry the fourth
whose heir my father was and i am his
he rose against him being his sovereign
and made him to resign his crown perforce
suppose my lords he did it unconstraind
think you twere prejudicial to his crown
no for he could not so resign his crown
but that the next heir should succeed and reign
art thou against us duke of exeter
his is the right and therefore pardon me
why whisper you my lords and answer not
my conscience tells me he is lawful king
plantagenet for all the claim thou layst
think not that henry shall be so deposed
deposed he shall be in despite of all
of essex norfolk suffolk nor of kent
which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud
can set the duke up in despite of me
king henry be thy title right or wrong
may that ground gape and swallow me alive
where i shall kneel to him that slew my father
o clifford how thy words revive my heart
henry of lancaster resign thy crown
what mutter you or what conspire you lords
do right unto this princely duke of york
or i will fill the house with armed men
and over the chair of state where now he sits
write up his title with usurping blood
let me for this my lifetime reign as king
confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs
and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest
enjoy the kingdom after my decease
what wrong is this unto the prince your son
what good is this to england and himself
base fearful and despairing henry
how hast thou injured both thyself and us
i cannot stay to hear these articles
nor i
come cousin let us tell the queen these news
farewell fainthearted and degenerate king
in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides
be thou a prey unto the house of york
and die in bands for this unmanly deed
in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome
or live in peace abandond and despised
turn this way henry and regard them not
they seek revenge and therefore will not yield
ah exeter
why should you sigh my lord
not for myself lord warwick but my son
whom i unnaturally shall disinherit
the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever
conditionally that here thou take an oath
to cease this civil war and whilst i live
to honour me as thy king and sovereign
and neither by treason nor hostility
to seek to put me down and reign thyself
this oath i willingly take and will perform
long live king henry plantagenet embrace him
and long live thou and these thy forward sons
now york and lancaster are reconciled
accursed be he that seeks to make them foes
farewell my gracious lord ill to my castle
and ill keep london with my soldiers
and i to norfolk with my followers
and i unto the sea from whence i came
and i with grief and sorrow to the court
ill steal away
exeter so will i
nay go not from me i will follow thee
be patient gentle queen and i will stay
who can be patient in such extremes
ah wretched man would i had died a maid
and never seen thee never borne thee son
seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus
hadst thou but loved him half so well as i
or felt that pain which i did for him once
or nourishd him as i did with my blood
thou wouldst have left thy dearest heartblood there
rather than have that savage duke thine heir
and disinherited thine only son
if you be king why should not i succeed
the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me
enforced thee art thou king and wilt be forced
i shame to hear thee speak ah timorous wretch
thou hast undone thyself thy son and me
and given unto the house of york such head
as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown
what is it but to make thy sepulchre
and creep into it far before thy time
warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais
stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas
the duke is made protector of the realm
and yet shalt thou be safe such safety finds
the trembling lamb environed with wolves
had i been there which am a silly woman
the soldiers should have tossd me on their pikes
before i would have granted to that act
and seeing thou dost i here divorce myself
both from thy table henry and thy bed
until that act of parliament be repeald
whereby my son is disinherited
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
will follow mine if once they see them spread
and spread they shall be to thy foul disgrace
and utter ruin of the house of york
thus do i leave thee come son lets away
our army is ready come well after them
stay gentle margaret and hear me speak
gentle son edward thou wilt stay with me
ay to be murderd by his enemies
when i return with victory from the field
come son away we may not linger thus
poor queen how love to me and to her son
hath made her break out into terms of rage
revenged may she be on that hateful duke
whose haughty spirit winged with desire
will cost my crown and like an empty eagle
tire on the flesh of me and of my son
ill write unto them and entreat them fair
come cousin you shall be the messenger
and i i hope shall reconcile them all
3 king henry vi
brother though i be youngest give me leave
no i can better play the orator
but i have reasons strong and forcible
why how now sons and brother at a strife
what is your quarrel how began it first
no quarrel but a slight contention
about what
about that which concerns your grace and us
the crown of england father which is yours
mine boy not till king henry be dead
your right depends not on his life or death
by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe
it will outrun you father in the end
i took an oath that he should quietly reign
i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year
no god forbid your grace should be forsworn
i shall be if i claim by open war
ill prove the contrary if youll hear me speak
thou canst not son it is impossible
an oath is of no moment being not took
before a true and lawful magistrate
henry had none but did usurp the place
then seeing twas he that made you to depose
your oath my lord is vain and frivolous
therefore to arms and father do but think
how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown
within whose circuit is elysium
and all that poets feign of bliss and joy
why do we finger thus i cannot rest
until the white rose that i wear be dyed
even in the lukewarm blood of henrys heart
richard enough i will be king or die
brother thou shalt to london presently
and whet on warwick to this enterprise
thou richard shalt to the duke of norfolk
and tell him privily of our intent
you edward shall unto my lord cobham
in them i trust for they are soldiers
witty courteous liberal full of spirit
while you are thus employd what resteth more
but that i seek occasion how to rise
and yet the king not privy to my drift
nor any of the house of lancaster
the queen with all the northern earls and lords
she is hard by with twenty thousand men
and therefore fortify your hold my lord
ay with my sword what thinkst thou that we fear them
edward and richard you shall stay with me
let noble warwick cobham and the rest
whom we have left protectors of the king
with powerful policy strengthen themselves
and trust not simple henry nor his oaths
and thus most humbly i do take my leave
sir john and sir hugh mortimer mine uncles
you are come to sandal in a happy hour
the army of the queen mean to besiege us
she shall not need well meet her in the field
what with five thousand men
a womans general what should we fear
and issue forth and bid them battle straight
five men to twenty though the odds be great
i doubt not uncle of our victory
many a battle have i won in france
why should i not now have the like success
3 king henry vi
ah whither shall i fly to scape their hands
ah tutor look where bloody clifford comes
chaplain away thy priesthood saves thy life
as for the brat of this accursed duke
whose father slew my father he shall die
and i my lord will bear him company
soldiers away with him
ah clifford murder not this innocent child
lest thou be hated both of god and man
how now is he dead already or is it fear
that makes him close his eyes ill open them
so looks the pentup lion oer the wretch
that trembles under his devouring paws
and so he walks insulting oer his prey
and so he comes to rend his limbs asunder
ah gentle clifford kill me with thy sword
and not with such a cruel threatening look
sweet clifford hear me speak before i die
be thou revenged on men and let me live
in vain thou speakst poor boy my fathers blood
hath stoppd the passage where thy words should enter
he is a man and clifford cope with him
had thy brethren here their lives and thine
were not revenge sufficient for me
no if i diggd up thy forefathers graves
and hung their rotten coffins up in chains
it could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart
the sight of any of the house of york
is as a fury to torment my soul
and till i root out their accursed line
and leave not one alive i live in hell
therefore
o let me pray before i take my death
to thee i pray sweet clifford pity me
such pity as my rapiers point affords
thy father hath
but twas ere i was born
thou hast one son for his sake pity me
lest in revenge thereof sith god is just
he be as miserably slain as i
ah let me live in prison all my days
and when i give occasion of offence
then let me die for now thou hast no cause
no cause
thy father slew my father therefore die
di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae
plantagenet i come plantagenet
and this thy sons blood cleaving to my blade
shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood
congeald with this do make me wipe off both
3 king henry vi
my uncles both are slain in rescuing me
and all my followers to the eager foe
turn back and fly like ships before the wind
or lambs pursued by hungerstarved wolves
but this i know they have demeand themselves
like men born to renown by life or death
three times did richard make a lane to me
and thrice cried courage father fight it out
and full as oft came edward to my side
with purple falchion painted to the hilt
and when the hardiest warriors did retire
richard cried charge and give no foot of ground
and cried a crown or else a glorious tomb
a sceptre or an earthly sepulchre
we bodged again as i have seen a swan
with bootless labour swim against the tide
and spend her strength with overmatching waves
ah hark the fatal followers do pursue
the sands are numberd that make up my life
here must i stay and here my life must end
come bloody clifford rough northumberland
i am your butt and i abide your shot
yield to our mercy proud plantagenet
ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm
with downright payment showd unto my father
now phaethon hath tumbled from his car
and made an evening at the noontide prick
my ashes as the phoenix may bring forth
and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven
scorning whateer you can afflict me with
why come you not what multitudes and fear
so cowards fight when they can fly no further
so doves do peck the falcons piercing talons
so desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives
breathe out invectives gainst the officers
o clifford but bethink thee once again
and in thy thought oerrun my former time
and if though canst for blushing view this face
and bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice
whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this
i will not bandy with thee word for word
but buckle with thee blows twice two for one
hold valiant clifford for a thousand causes
i would prolong awhile the traitors life
hold clifford do not honour him so much
what valour were it when a cur doth grin
for one to thrust his hand between his teeth
when he might spurn him with his foot away
it is wars prize to take all vantages
and ten to one is no impeach of valour
ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin
so doth the cony struggle in the net
so triumph thieves upon their conquerd booty
so true men yield with robbers so oermatchd
what would your grace have done unto him now
brave warriors clifford and northumberland
come make him stand upon this molehill here
that raught at mountains with outstretched arms
yet parted but the shadow with his hand
what was it you that would be englands king
wast you that revelld in our parliament
and made a preachment of your high descent
where are your mess of sons to back you now
the wanton edward and the lusty george
and wheres that valiant crookback prodigy
dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice
was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies
or with the rest where is your darling rutland
that valiant clifford with his rapiers point
made issue from the bosom of the boy
and if thine eyes can water for his death
i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal
alas poor york but that i hate thee deadly
i should lament thy miserable state
i prithee grieve to make me merry york
what hath thy fiery heart so parchd thine entrails
that not a tear can fall for rutlands death
why art thou patient man thou shouldst be mad
and i to make thee mad do mock thee thus
stamp rave and fret that i may sing and dance
york cannot speak unless he wear a crown
hold you his hands whilst i do set it on
ay marry sir now looks he like a king
ay this is he that took king henrys chair
and this is he was his adopted heir
but how is it that great plantagenet
is crownd so soon and broke his solemn oath
as i bethink me you should not be king
till our king henry had shook hands with death
and will you pale your head in henrys glory
and rob his temples of the diadem
now in his life against your holy oath
o tis a fault too too unpardonable
off with the crown and with the crown his head
and whilst we breathe take time to do him dead
that is my office for my fathers sake
nay stay lets hear the orisons he makes
shewolf of france but worse than wolves of france
whose tongue more poisons than the adders tooth
how illbeseeming is it in thy sex
to triumph like an amazonian trull
upon their woes whom fortune captivates
but that thy face is vizardlike unchanging
made impudent with use of evil deeds
i would assay proud queen to make thee blush
to tell thee whence thou camest of whom derived
were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless
thy father bears the type of king of naples
of both the sicils and jerusalem
yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman
hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult
it needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen
unless the adage must be verified
that beggars mounted run their horse to death
tis beauty that doth oft make women proud
tis virtue that doth make them most admired
tis government that makes them seem divine
thou art as opposite to every good
as the antipodes are unto us
or as the south to the septentrion
o tigers heart wrapt in a womans hide
how couldst thou drain the lifeblood of the child
to bid the father wipe his eyes withal
and yet be seen to bear a womans face
women are soft mild pitiful and flexible
thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless
for raging wind blows up incessant showers
and when the rage allays the rain begins
and every drop cries vengeance for his death
gainst thee fell clifford and thee false
frenchwoman
beshrew me but his passion moves me so
that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears
that face of his the hungry cannibals
but you are more inhuman more inexorable
o ten times more than tigers of hyrcania
this cloth thou dipdst in blood of my sweet boy
and i with tears do wash the blood away
and if thou tellst the heavy story right
upon my soul the hearers will shed tears
yea even my foes will shed fastfalling tears
and say alas it was a piteous deed
there take the crown and with the crown my curse
and in thy need such comfort come to thee
as now i reap at thy too cruel hand
my soul to heaven my blood upon your heads
had he been slaughterman to all my kin
i should not for my life but weep with him
to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul
what weepingripe my lord northumberland
think but upon the wrong he did us all
and that will quickly dry thy melting tears
heres for my oath heres for my fathers death
and heres to right our gentlehearted king
open thy gate of mercy gracious god
my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee
off with his head and set it on york gates
so york may overlook the town of york
3 king henry vi
i wonder how our princely father scaped
or whether he be scaped away or no
had he been taen we should have heard the news
had he been slain we should have heard the news
or had he scaped methinks we should have heard
the happy tidings of his good escape
how fares my brother why is he so sad
i cannot joy until i be resolved
where our right valiant father is become
i saw him in the battle range about
and watchd him how he singled clifford forth
methought he bore him in the thickest troop
as doth a lion in a herd of neat
or as a bear encompassd round with dogs
who having pinchd a few and made them cry
the rest stand all aloof and bark at him
so fared our father with his enemies
methinks tis prize enough to be his son
see how the morning opes her golden gates
and takes her farewell of the glorious sun
how well resembles it the prime of youth
trimmd like a younker prancing to his love
dazzle mine eyes or do i see three suns
three glorious suns each one a perfect sun
not separated with the racking clouds
but severd in a pale clearshining sky
see see they join embrace and seem to kiss
now are they but one lamp one light one sun
in this the heaven figures some event
tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of
i think it cites us brother to the field
that we the sons of brave plantagenet
each one already blazing by our meeds
should notwithstanding join our lights together
and overshine the earth as this the world
whateer it bodes henceforward will i bear
upon my target three fairshining suns
you love the breeder better than the male
but what art thou whose heavy looks foretell
some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue
ah one that was a woful lookeron
when as the noble duke of york was slain
your princely father and my loving lord
o speak no more for i have heard too much
say how he died for i will hear it all
environed he was with many foes
and stood against them as the hope of troy
against the greeks that would have enterd troy
but hercules himself must yield to odds
and many strokes though with a little axe
hew down and fell the hardesttimberd oak
by many hands your father was subdued
but only slaughterd by the ireful arm
of unrelenting clifford and the queen
who crownd the gracious duke in high despite
laughd in his face and when with grief he wept
the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
a napkin steeped in the harmless blood
and after many scorns many foul taunts
they took his head and on the gates of york
they set the same and there it doth remain
the saddest spectacle that eer i viewd
sweet duke of york our prop to lean upon
now thou art gone we have no staff no stay
o clifford boisterous clifford thou hast slain
the flower of europe for his chivalry
and treacherously hast thou vanquishd him
for hand to hand he would have vanquishd thee
ah would she break from hence that this my body
might in the ground be closed up in rest
for never henceforth shall i joy again
never o never shall i see more joy
i cannot weep for all my bodys moisture
nor can my tongue unload my hearts great burthen
for selfsame wind that i should speak withal
is kindling coals that fires all my breast
and burns me up with flames that tears would quench
tears then for babes blows and revenge for me
richard i bear thy name ill venge thy death
or die renowned by attempting it
his name that valiant duke hath left with thee
his dukedom and his chair with me is left
nay if thou be that princely eagles bird
for chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say
either that is thine or else thou wert not his
how now fair lords what fare what news abroad
great lord of warwick if we should recount
our baleful news and at each words deliverance
stab poniards in our flesh till all were told
the words would add more anguish than the wounds
o valiant lord the duke of york is slain
o warwick warwick that plantagenet
which held three dearly as his souls redemption
is by the stern lord clifford done to death
ten days ago i drownd these news in tears
and now to add more measure to your woes
i come to tell you things sith then befalln
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought
where your brave father breathed his latest gasp
tidings as swiftly as the posts could run
were brought me of your loss and his depart
i then in london keeper of the king
musterd my soldiers gatherd flocks of friends
and very well appointed as i thought
marchd toward saint albans to intercept the queen
bearing the king in my behalf along
for by my scouts i was advertised
that she was coming with a full intent
to dash our late decree in parliament
touching king henrys oath and your succession
short tale to make we at saint albans met
but whether twas the coldness of the king
who lookd full gently on his warlike queen
that robbd my soldiers of their heated spleen
or whether twas report of her success
or more than common fear of cliffords rigour
who thunders to his captives blood and death
their weapons like to lightning came and went
our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight
or like an idle thresher with a flail
fell gently down as if they struck their friends
i cheerd them up with justice of our cause
but all in vain they had no heart to fight
and we in them no hope to win the day
so that we fled the king unto the queen
lord george your brother norfolk and myself
for in the marches here we heard you were
making another head to fight again
where is the duke of norfolk gentle warwick
and when came george from burgundy to england
some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers
and for your brother he was lately sent
from your kind aunt duchess of burgundy
with aid of soldiers to this needful war
oft have i heard his praises in pursuit
but neer till now his scandal of retire
nor now my scandal richard dost thou hear
for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
can pluck the diadem from faint henrys head
and wring the awful sceptre from his fist
were he as famous and as bold in war
as he is famed for mildness peace and prayer
tis love i bear thy glories makes me speak
but in this troublous time whats to be done
shall we go throw away our coats of steel
and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns
numbering our avemaries with our beads
or shall we on the helmets of our foes
tell our devotion with revengeful arms
if for the last say ay and to it lords
why therefore warwick came to seek you out
and therefore comes my brother montague
attend me lords the proud insulting queen
with clifford and the haught northumberland
and of their feather many more proud birds
have wrought the easymelting king like wax
he swore consent to your succession
his oath enrolled in the parliament
and now to london all the crew are gone
to frustrate both his oath and what beside
may make against the house of lancaster
now if the help of norfolk and myself
with all the friends that thou brave earl of march
amongst the loving welshmen canst procure
will but amount to five and twenty thousand
why via to london will we march amain
and once again bestride our foaming steeds
and once again cry charge upon our foes
but never once again turn back and fly
neer may he live to see a sunshine day
that cries retire if warwick bid him stay
lord warwick on thy shoulder will i lean
and when thou failstas god forbid the hour
must edward fall which peril heaven forfend
the next degree is englands royal throne
for king of england shalt thou be proclaimd
in every borough as we pass along
and he that throws not up his cap for joy
shall for the fault make forfeit of his head
king edward valiant richard montague
stay we no longer dreaming of renown
but sound the trumpets and about our task
then clifford were thy heart as hard as steel
as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds
i come to pierce it or to give thee mine
how now what news
the duke of norfolk sends you word by me
the queen is coming with a puissant host
and craves your company for speedy counsel
why then it sorts brave warriors lets away
3 king henry vi
welcome my lord to this brave town of york
yonders the head of that archenemy
doth not the object cheer your heart my lord
to see this sight it irks my very soul
withhold revenge dear god tis not my fault
nor wittingly have i infringed my vow
my gracious liege this too much lenity
and harmful pity must be laid aside
to whom do lions cast their gentle looks
not to the beast that would usurp their den
whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick
not his that spoils her young before her face
who scapes the lurking serpents mortal sting
not he that sets his foot upon her back
the smallest worm will turn being trodden on
and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood
ambitious york doth level at thy crown
he but a duke would have his son a king
and raise his issue like a loving sire
thou being a king blest with a goodly son
didst yield consent to disinherit him
which argued thee a most unloving father
unreasonable creatures feed their young
and though mans face be fearful to their eyes
yet in protection of their tender ones
who hath not seen them even with those wings
which sometime they have used with fearful flight
make war with him that climbd unto their nest
offer their own lives in their youngs defence
for shame my liege make them your precedent
were it not pity that this goodly boy
should lose his birthright by his fathers fault
and long hereafter say unto his child
what my greatgrandfather and his grandsire got
my careless father fondly gave away
ah what a shame were this look on the boy
and let his manly face which promiseth
successful fortune steel thy melting heart
to hold thine own and leave thine own with him
full well hath clifford playd the orator
inferring arguments of mighty force
but clifford tell me didst thou never hear
that things illgot had ever bad success
and happy always was it for that son
whose father for his hoarding went to hell
ill leave my son my virtuous deeds behind
and would my father had left me no more
for all the rest is held at such a rate
as brings a thousandfold more care to keep
than in possession and jot of pleasure
ah cousin york would thy best friends did know
how it doth grieve me that thy head is here
and this soft courage makes your followers faint
unsheathe your sword and dub him presently
edward kneel down
edward plantagenet arise a knight
and learn this lesson draw thy sword in right
my gracious father by your kingly leave
ill draw it as apparent to the crown
and in that quarrel use it to the death
why that is spoken like a toward prince
for with a band of thirty thousand men
comes warwick backing of the duke of york
and in the towns as they do march along
darraign your battle for they are at hand
the queen hath best success when you are absent
ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune
why thats my fortune too therefore ill stay
be it with resolution then to fight
my royal father cheer these noble lords
unsheathe your sword good father cry saint george
now perjured henry wilt thou kneel for grace
and set thy diadem upon my head
or bide the mortal fortune of the field
go rate thy minions proud insulting boy
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
before thy sovereign and thy lawful king
i am his king and he should bow his knee
since when his oath is broke for as i hear
you that are king though he do wear the crown
have caused him by new act of parliament
to blot out me and put his own son in
who should succeed the father but the son
are you there butcher o i cannot speak
ay crookback here i stand to answer thee
or any he the proudest of thy sort
twas you that killd young rutland was it not
ay and old york and yet not satisfied
for gods sake lords give signal to the fight
what sayst thou henry wilt thou yield the crown
why how now longtongued warwick dare you speak
when you and i met at saint albans last
your legs did better service than your hands
then twas my turn to fly and now tis thine
you said so much before and yet you fled
twas not your valour clifford drove me thence
no nor your manhood that durst make you stay
northumberland i hold thee reverently
break off the parley for scarce i can refrain
the execution of my bigswoln heart
upon that clifford that cruel childkiller
i slew thy father callst thou him a child
ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward
as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland
but ere sunset ill make thee curse the deed
have done with words my lords and hear me speak
defy them then or else hold close thy lips
i am a king and privileged to speak
my liege the wound that bred this meeting here
cannot be cured by words therefore be still
by him that made us all i am resolved
that cliffords manhood lies upon his tongue
say henry shall i have my right or no
a thousand men have broke their fasts today
that neer shall dine unless thou yield the crown
if thou deny their blood upon thy head
for york in justice puts his armour on
if that be right which warwick says is right
there is no wrong but every thing is right
whoever got thee there thy mother stands
for well i wot thou hast thy mothers tongue
but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam
but like a foul misshapen stigmatic
markd by the destinies to be avoided
as venom toads or lizards dreadful stings
iron of naples hid with english gilt
whose father bears the title of a king
as if a channel should be calld the sea
shamest thou not knowing whence thou art extraught
to let thy tongue detect thy baseborn heart
a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns
to make this shameless callet know herself
helen of greece was fairer far than thou
although thy husband may be menelaus
and neer was agamemnons brother wrongd
by that false woman as this king by thee
his father revelld in the heart of france
and tamed the king and made the dauphin stoop
and had he matchd according to his state
he might have kept that glory to this day
but when he took a beggar to his bed
and graced thy poor sire with his bridalday
even then that sunshine brewd a shower for him
that washd his fathers fortunes forth of france
and heapd sedition on his crown at home
for what hath broachd this tumult but thy pride
hadst thou been meek our title still had slept
and we in pity of the gentle king
had slippd our claim until another age
but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring
and that thy summer bred us no increase
we set the axe to thy usurping root
and though the edge hath something hit ourselves
yet know thou since we have begun to strike
well never leave till we have hewn thee down
or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods
and in this resolution i defy thee
not willing any longer conference
since thou deniest the gentle king to speak
sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave
and either victory or else a grave
stay edward
these words will cost ten thousand lives this day
3 king henry vi
forspent with toil as runners with a race
i lay me down a little while to breathe
for strokes received and many blows repaid
have robbd my strongknit sinews of their strength
and spite of spite needs must i rest awhile
smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death
for this world frowns and edwards sun is clouded
how now my lord what hap what hope of good
our hap is loss our hope but sad despair
what counsel give you whither shall we fly
bootless is flight they follow us with wings
and weak we are and cannot shun pursuit
ah warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself
thy brothers blood the thirsty earth hath drunk
broachd with the steely point of cliffords lance
and in the very pangs of death he cried
like to a dismal clangour heard from far
warwick revenge brother revenge my death
so underneath the belly of their steeds
that staind their fetlocks in his smoking blood
the noble gentleman gave up the ghost
ill kill my horse because i will not fly
why stand we like softhearted women here
wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage
and look upon as if the tragedy
were playd in jest by counterfeiting actors
here on my knee i vow to god above
ill never pause again never stand still
till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
or fortune given me measure of revenge
o warwick i do bend my knee with thine
and in this vow do chain my soul to thine
and ere my knee rise from the earths cold face
i throw my hands mine eyes my heart to thee
thou setter up and plucker down of kings
beseeching thee if with they will it stands
that to my foes this body must be prey
yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope
and give sweet passage to my sinful soul
now lords take leave until we meet again
whereer it be in heaven or in earth
brother give me thy hand and gentle warwick
i that did never weep now melt with woe
that winter should cut off our springtime so
away away once more sweet lords farewell
yet let us all together to our troops
and give them leave to fly that will not stay
and call them pillars that will stand to us
and if we thrive promise them such rewards
this may plant courage in their quailing breasts
for yet is hope of life and victory
forslow no longer make we hence amain
3 king henry vi
suppose this arm is for the duke of york
and this for rutland both bound to revenge
wert thou environd with a brazen wall
this is the hand that stabbd thy father york
and this the hand that slew thy brother rutland
and heres the heart that triumphs in their death
and cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
to execute the like upon thyself
and so have at thee
nay warwick single out some other chase
for i myself will hunt this wolf to death
3 king henry vi
this battle fares like to the mornings war
when dying clouds contend with growing light
what time the shepherd blowing of his nails
can neither call it perfect day nor night
now sways it this way like a mighty sea
forced by the tide to combat with the wind
now sways it that way like the selfsame sea
sometime the flood prevails and then the wind
now one the better then another best
both tugging to be victors breast to breast
so is the equal of this fell war
here on this molehill will i sit me down
to whom god will there be the victory
for margaret my queen and clifford too
have chid me from the battle swearing both
they prosper best of all when i am thence
would i were dead if gods good will were so
for what is in this world but grief and woe
o god methinks it were a happy life
to be no better than a homely swain
to sit upon a hill as i do now
to carve out dials quaintly point by point
thereby to see the minutes how they run
how many make the hour full complete
how many hours bring about the day
how many days will finish up the year
how many years a mortal man may live
so many hours must i tend my flock
so many hours must i take my rest
so many hours must i contemplate
so many hours must i sport myself
so many days my ewes have been with young
so minutes hours days months and years
passd over to the end they were created
would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave
ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely
gives not the hawthornbush a sweeter shade
to shepherds looking on their silly sheep
than doth a rich embroiderd canopy
to kings that fear their subjects treachery
o yes it doth a thousandfold it doth
and to conclude the shepherds homely curds
his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle
his wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade
all which secure and sweetly he enjoys
is far beyond a princes delicates
his viands sparkling in a golden cup
his body couched in a curious bed
when care mistrust and treason waits on him
ill blows the wind that profits nobody
this man whom hand to hand i slew in fight
may be possessed with some store of crowns
and i that haply take them from him now
may yet ere night yield both my life and them
to some man else as this dead man doth me
whos this o god it is my fathers face
whom in this conflict i unwares have killd
o heavy times begetting such events
from london by the king was i pressd forth
my father being the earl of warwicks man
came on the part of york pressd by his master
and i who at his hands received my life him
have by my hands of life bereaved him
pardon me god i knew not what i did
and pardon father for i knew not thee
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks
and no more words till they have flowd their fill
o piteous spectacle o bloody times
whiles lions war and battle for their dens
poor harmless lambs abide their enmity
weep wretched man ill aid thee tear for tear
and let our hearts and eyes like civil war
be blind with tears and break oercharged with grief
thou that so stoutly hast resisted me
for i have bought it with an hundred blows
ah no no no it is mine only son
ah boy if any life be left in thee
throw up thine eye see see what showers arise
blown with the windy tempest of my heart
upon thy words that kill mine eye and heart
o pity god this miserable age
what stratagems how fell how butcherly
erroneous mutinous and unnatural
this deadly quarrel daily doth beget
o boy thy father gave thee life too soon
and hath bereft thee of thy life too late
woe above woe grief more than common grief
o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds
o pity pity gentle heaven pity
the red rose and the white are on his face
the one his purple blood right well resembles
wither one rose and let the other flourish
if you contend a thousand lives must wither
how will my mother for a fathers death
take on with me and neer be satisfied
how will my wife for slaughter of my son
shed seas of tears and neer be satisfied
how will the country for these woful chances
misthink the king and not be satisfied
was ever son so rued a fathers death
was ever father so bemoand his son
was ever king so grieved for subjects woe
much is your sorrow mine ten times so much
ill bear thee hence where i may weep my fill
these arms of mine shall be thy windingsheet
my heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre
for from my heart thine image neer shall go
my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell
and so obsequious will thy father be
even for the loss of thee having no more
as priam was for all his valiant sons
ill bear thee hence and let them fight that will
for i have murdered where i should not kill
sadhearted men much overgone with care
here sits a king more woful than you are
fly father fly for all your friends are fled
away for death doth hold us in pursuit
edward and richard like a brace of greyhounds
having the fearful flying hare in sight
with fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath
and bloody steel graspd in their ireful hands
are at our backs and therefore hence amain
nay stay not to expostulate make speed
not that i fear to stay but love to go
whither the queen intends forward away
3 king henry vi
here burns my candle out ay here it dies
which whiles it lasted gave king henry light
o lancaster i fear thy overthrow
more than my bodys parting with my soul
my love and fear glued many friends to thee
and now i fall thy tough commixture melts
impairing henry strengthening misproud york
the common people swarm like summer flies
and whither fly the gnats but to the sun
and who shines now but henrys enemies
o phoebus hadst thou never given consent
that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds
thy burning car never had scorchd the earth
and henry hadst thou swayd as kings should do
or as thy father and his father did
giving no ground unto the house of york
they never then had sprung like summer flies
i and ten thousand in this luckless realm
had left no mourning widows for our death
and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity
bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds
the foe is merciless and will not pity
for at their hands i have deserved no pity
the air hath got into my deadly wounds
and much effuse of blood doth make me faint
come york and richard warwick and the rest
i stabbd your fathers bosoms split my breast
and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks
some troops pursue the bloodyminded queen
that led calm henry though he were a king
as doth a sail filld with a fretting gust
command an argosy to stem the waves
but think you lords that clifford fled with them
no tis impossible he should escape
for though before his face i speak the words
and wheresoeer he is hes surely dead
whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave
a deadly groan like life and deaths departing
if friend or foe let him be gently used
revoke that doom of mercy for tis clifford
who not contented that he loppd the branch
in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth
but set his murdering knife unto the root
from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring
i mean our princely father duke of york
from off the gates of york fetch down the head
your fathers head which clifford placed there
measure for measure must be answered
bring forth that fatal screechowl to our house
now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound
and his illboding tongue no more shall speak
i think his understanding is bereft
speak clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee
dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life
and he nor sees nor hears us what we say
tis but his policy to counterfeit
because he would avoid such bitter taunts
which in the time of death he gave our father
if so thou thinkst vex him with eager words
clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace
clifford repent in bootless penitence
clifford devise excuses for thy faults
while we devise fell tortures for thy faults
thou didst love york and i am son to york
thou pitiedst rutland i will pity thee
wheres captain margaret to fence you now
what not an oath nay then the world goes hard
when clifford cannot spare his friends an oath
i know by that hes dead and by my soul
if this right hand would buy two hours life
that i in all despite might rail at him
this hand should chop it off and with the
issuing blood
stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
york and young rutland could not satisfy
and rear it in the place your fathers stands
and now to london with triumphant march
from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france
so shalt thou sinew both these lands together
and having france thy friend thou shalt not dread
the scatterd foe that hopes to rise again
for though they cannot greatly sting to hurt
yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears
first will i see the coronation
and then to brittany ill cross the sea
to effect this marriage so it please my lord
even as thou wilt sweet warwick let it be
for in thy shoulder do i build my seat
and never will i undertake the thing
wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting
richard i will create thee duke of gloucester
shall do and undo as him pleaseth best
let me be duke of clarence george of gloucester
for gloucesters dukedom is too ominous
richard be duke of gloucester now to london
to see these honours in possession
3 king henry vi
under this thickgrown brake well shroud ourselves
for through this laund anon the deer will come
and in this covert will we make our stand
culling the principal of all the deer
ill stay above the hill so both may shoot
that cannot be the noise of thy crossbow
will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost
and for the time shall not seem tedious
ill tell thee what befell me on a day
in this selfplace where now we mean to stand
here comes a man lets stay till he be past
from scotland am i stoln even of pure love
to greet mine own land with my wishful sight
no harry harry tis no land of thine
thy place is filld thy sceptre wrung from thee
no bending knee will call thee caesar now
no humble suitors press to speak for right
no not a man comes for redress of thee
for how can i help them and not myself
this is the quondam king lets seize upon him
let me embrace thee sour adversity
for wise men say it is the wisest course
why linger we let us lay hands upon him
forbear awhile well hear a little more
my queen and son are gone to france for aid
and as i hear the great commanding warwick
is thither gone to crave the french kings sister
poor queen and son your labour is but lost
for warwick is a subtle orator
and lewis a prince soon won with moving words
by this account then margaret may win him
her sighs will make a battery in his breast
her tears will pierce into a marble heart
the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn
and nero will be tainted with remorse
to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears
ay but shes come to beg warwick to give
she on his left side craving aid for henry
he on his right asking a wife for edward
she weeps and says her henry is deposed
he smiles and says his edward is installd
that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more
whiles warwick tells his title smooths the wrong
inferreth arguments of mighty strength
and in conclusion wins the king from her
with promise of his sister and what else
to strengthen and support king edwards place
o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul
art then forsaken as thou wentst forlorn
say what art thou that talkst of kings and queens
a man at least for less i should not be
and men may talk of kings and why not i
ay but thou talkst as if thou wert a king
why so i am in mind and thats enough
but if thou be a king where is thy crown
my crown is in my heart not on my head
not decked with diamonds and indian stones
a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy
well if you be a king crownd with content
your crown content and you must be contented
to go along with us for as we think
you are the king king edward hath deposed
and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
will apprehend you as his enemy
but did you never swear and break an oath
no never such an oath nor will not now
where did you dwell when i was king of england
here in this country where we now remain
i was anointed king at nine months old
my father and my grandfather were kings
and tell me then have you not broke your oaths
no
for we were subjects but while you were king
why am i dead do i not breathe a man
ah simple men you know not what you swear
look as i blow this feather from my face
and as the air blows it to me again
obeying with my wind when i do blow
and yielding to another when it blows
commanded always by the greater gust
such is the lightness of you common men
but do not break your oaths for of that sin
my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty
go where you will the king shall be commanded
and be you kings command and ill obey
we are true subjects to the king king edward
so would you be again to henry
if he were seated as king edward is
we charge you in gods name and the kings
to go with us unto the officers
and what god will that let your king perform
and what he will i humbly yield unto
3 king henry vi
brother of gloucester at saint albans field
this ladys husband sir richard grey was slain
her suit is now to repossess those lands
which we in justice cannot well deny
because in quarrel of the house of york
the worthy gentleman did lose his life
your highness shall do well to grant her suit
it were dishonour to deny it her
it were no less but yet ill make a pause
widow we will consider of your suit
and come some other time to know our mind
may it please your highness to resolve me now
and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me
how many children hast thou widow tell me
three my most gracious lord
twere pity they should lose their fathers lands
be pitiful dread lord and grant it then
now tell me madam do you love your children
ay full as dearly as i love myself
and would you not do much to do them good
to do them good i would sustain some harm
then get your husbands lands to do them good
therefore i came unto your majesty
ill tell you how these lands are to be got
so shall you bind me to your highness service
what service wilt thou do me if i give them
what you command that rests in me to do
but you will take exceptions to my boon
no gracious lord except i cannot do it
ay but thou canst do what i mean to ask
why then i will do what your grace commands
why stops my lord shall i not hear my task
an easy task tis but to love a king
thats soon performd because i am a subject
why then thy husbands lands i freely give thee
i take my leave with many thousand thanks
but stay thee tis the fruits of love i mean
the fruits of love i mean my loving liege
ay but i fear me in another sense
what love thinkst thou i sue so much to get
my love till death my humble thanks my prayers
that love which virtue begs and virtue grants
no by my troth i did not mean such love
why then you mean not as i thought you did
but now you partly may perceive my mind
my mind will never grant what i perceive
your highness aims at if i aim aright
to tell thee plain i aim to lie with thee
to tell you plain i had rather lie in prison
why then thou shalt not have thy husbands lands
why then mine honesty shall be my dower
for by that loss i will not purchase them
therein thou wrongst thy children mightily
herein your highness wrongs both them and me
but mighty lord this merry inclination
please you dismiss me either with ay or no
ay if thou wilt say ay to my request
no if thou dost say no to my demand
then no my lord my suit is at an end
i am a subject fit to jest withal
but far unfit to be a sovereign
sweet widow by my state i swear to thee
i speak no more than what my soul intends
and that is to enjoy thee for my love
i know i am too mean to be your queen
and yet too good to be your concubine
twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father
no more than when my daughters call thee mother
thou art a widow and thou hast some children
and by gods mother i being but a bachelor
to be the father unto many sons
answer no more for thou shalt be my queen
brothers you muse what chat we two have had
the widow likes it not for she looks very sad
youll think it strange if i should marry her
to whom my lord
why clarence to myself
that would be ten days wonder at the least
thats a day longer than a wonder lasts
by so much is the wonder in extremes
her suit is granted for her husbands lands
my gracious lord henry your foe is taken
and brought your prisoner to your palace gate
and go we brothers to the man that took him
to question of his apprehension
widow go you along lords use her honourably
ay edward will use women honourably
would he were wasted marrow bones and all
that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring
to cross me from the golden time i look for
and yet between my souls desire and me
the lustful edwards title buried
is clarence henry and his son young edward
and all the unlookd for issue of their bodies
a cold premeditation for my purpose
why then i do but dream on sovereignty
like one that stands upon a promontory
and spies a faroff shore where he would tread
wishing his foot were equal with his eye
and chides the sea that sunders him from thence
so do i wish the crown being so far off
and so i chide the means that keeps me from it
and so i say ill cut the causes off
flattering me with impossibilities
my eyes too quick my heart oerweens too much
unless my hand and strength could equal them
well say there is no kingdom then for richard
what other pleasure can the world afford
ill make my heaven in a ladys lap
and deck my body in gay ornaments
and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks
o miserable thought and more unlikely
than to accomplish twenty golden crowns
and for i should not deal in her soft laws
she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe
to shrink mine arm up like a witherd shrub
to make an envious mountain on my back
where sits deformity to mock my body
to shape my legs of an unequal size
to disproportion me in every part
like to a chaos or an unlickd bearwhelp
that carries no impression like the dam
and am i then a man to be beloved
o monstrous fault to harbour such a thought
then since this earth affords no joy to me
but to command to cheque to oerbear such
as are of better person than myself
ill make my heaven to dream upon the crown
and whiles i live to account this world but hell
until my misshaped trunk that bears this head
be round impaled with a glorious crown
and yet i know not how to get the crown
and ilike one lost in a thorny wood
that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns
seeking a way and straying from the way
not knowing how to find the open air
but toiling desperately to find it out
and from that torment i will free myself
or hew my way out with a bloody axe
why i can smile and murder whiles i smile
and cry content to that which grieves my heart
and wet my cheeks with artificial tears
and frame my face to all occasions
ill drown more sailors than the mermaid shall
ill slay more gazers than the basilisk
ill play the orator as well as nestor
deceive more slily than ulysses could
and like a sinon take another troy
i can add colours to the chameleon
change shapes with proteus for advantages
and set the murderous machiavel to school
can i do this and cannot get a crown
tut were it farther off ill pluck it down
3 king henry vi
fair queen of england worthy margaret
and birth that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit
must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
where kings command i was i must confess
but now mischance hath trod my title down
and with dishonour laid me on the ground
where i must take like seat unto my fortune
and to my humble seat conform myself
why say fair queen whence springs this deep despair
from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
and stops my tongue while heart is drownd in cares
whateer it be be thou still like thyself
yield not thy neck
to fortunes yoke but let thy dauntless mind
still ride in triumph over all mischance
be plain queen margaret and tell thy grief
it shall be eased if france can yield relief
those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
and give my tonguetied sorrows leave to speak
now therefore be it known to noble lewis
that henry sole possessor of my love
is of a king become a banishd man
and forced to live in scotland a forlorn
while proud ambitious edward duke of york
usurps the regal title and the seat
of englands trueanointed lawful king
this is the cause that i poor margaret
with this my son prince edward henrys heir
am come to crave thy just and lawful aid
scotland hath will to help but cannot help
our people and our peers are both misled
our treasures seized our soldiers put to flight
and as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight
renowned queen with patience calm the storm
while we bethink a means to break it off
the more we stay the stronger grows our foe
the more i stay the more ill succor thee
o but impatience waiteth on true sorrow
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow
whats he approacheth boldly to our presence
our earl of warwick edwards greatest friend
welcome brave warwick what brings thee to france
ay now begins a second storm to rise
for this is he that moves both wind and tide
from worthy edward king of albion
my lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend
i come in kindness and unfeigned love
first to do greetings to thy royal person
and then to crave a league of amity
and lastly to confirm that amity
with a nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant
that virtuous lady bona thy fair sister
to englands king in lawful marriage
king lewis and lady bona hear me speak
before you answer warwick his demand
springs not from edwards wellmeant honest love
but from deceit bred by necessity
for how can tyrants safely govern home
unless abroad they purchase great alliance
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice
yet here prince edward stands king henrys son
look therefore lewis that by this league and marriage
thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour
for though usurpers sway the rule awhile
yet heavens are just and time suppresseth wrongs
injurious margaret
and why not queen
because thy father henry did usurp
and thou no more are prince than she is queen
then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt
which did subdue the greatest part of spain
and after john of gaunt henry the fourth
whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest
and after that wise prince henry the fifth
from these our henry lineally descends
oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse
you told not how henry the sixth hath lost
all that which henry fifth had gotten
methinks these peers of france should smile at that
but for the rest you tell a pedigree
of threescore and two years a silly time
to make prescription for a kingdoms worth
why warwick canst thou speak against thy liege
whom thou obeyedst thirty and six years
and not bewray thy treason with a blush
can oxford that did ever fence the right
now buckler falsehood with a pedigree
for shame leave henry and call edward king
call him my king by whose injurious doom
my elder brother the lord aubrey vere
was done to death and more than so my father
even in the downfall of his mellowd years
when nature brought him to the door of death
no warwick no while life upholds this arm
this arm upholds the house of lancaster
and i the house of york
queen margaret prince edward and oxford
vouchsafe at our request to stand aside
while i use further conference with warwick
heavens grant that warwicks words bewitch him not
now warwick tell me even upon thy conscience
is edward your true king for i were loath
to link with him that were not lawful chosen
thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour
but is he gracious in the peoples eye
the more that henry was unfortunate
then further all dissembling set aside
tell me for truth the measure of his love
unto our sister bona
such it seems
as may beseem a monarch like himself
myself have often heard him say and swear
that this his love was an eternal plant
whereof the root was fixd in virtues ground
the leaves and fruit maintaind with beautys sun
exempt from envy but not from disdain
unless the lady bona quit his pain
now sister let us hear your firm resolve
yet i confess that often ere this day
when i have heard your kings desert recounted
mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire
and now forthwith shall articles be drawn
touching the jointure that your king must make
which with her dowry shall be counterpoised
draw near queen margaret and be a witness
that bona shall be wife to the english king
to edward but not to the english king
deceitful warwick it was thy device
before thy coming lewis was henrys friend
but if your title to the crown be weak
as may appear by edwards good success
then tis but reason that i be released
from giving aid which late i promised
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
that your estate requires and mine can yield
henry now lives in scotland at his ease
where having nothing nothing can he lose
and as for you yourself our quondam queen
you have a father able to maintain you
and better twere you troubled him than france
peace impudent and shameless warwick peace
proud setter up and puller down of kings
i will not hence till with my talk and tears
both full of truth i make king lewis behold
thy sly conveyance and thy lords false love
for both of you are birds of selfsame feather
warwick this is some post to us or thee
i like it well that our fair queen and mistress
smiles at her news while warwick frowns at his
i hope alls for the best
warwick what are thy news and yours fair queen
mine such as fill my heart with unhoped joys
mine full of sorrow and hearts discontent
what has your king married the lady grey
and now to soothe your forgery and his
sends me a paper to persuade me patience
is this the alliance that he seeks with france
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner
this proveth edwards love and warwicks honesty
king lewis i here protest in sight of heaven
and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss
that i am clear from this misdeed of edwards
no more my king for he dishonours me
but most himself if he could see his shame
did i forget that by the house of york
my father came untimely to his death
did i let pass the abuse done to my niece
did i impale him with the regal crown
did i put henry from his native right
and am i guerdond at the last with shame
and to repair my honour lost for him
i here renounce him and return to henry
my noble queen let former grudges pass
i will revenge his wrong to lady bona
and replant henry in his former state
warwick these words have turnd my hate to love
and i forgive and quite forget old faults
and joy that thou becomest king henrys friend
so much his friend ay his unfeigned friend
that if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
with some few bands of chosen soldiers
ill undertake to land them on our coast
and force the tyrant from his seat by war
and as for clarence as my letters tell me
hes very likely now to fall from him
for matching more for wanton lust than honour
or than for strength and safety of our country
dear brother how shall bona be revenged
but by thy help to this distressed queen
renowned prince how shall poor henry live
unless thou rescue him from foul despair
my quarrel and this english queens are one
and mine fair lady bona joins with yours
and mine with hers and thine and margarets
therefore at last i firmly am resolved
you shall have aid
let me give humble thanks for all at once
then englands messenger return in post
and tell false edward thy supposed king
that lewis of france is sending over masquers
thou seest whats past go fear thy king withal
tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly
ill wear the willow garland for his sake
tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside
and i am ready to put armour on
tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long
but warwick
thou and oxford with five thousand men
shall cross the seas and bid false edward battle
and as occasion serves this noble queen
and prince shall follow with a fresh supply
yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt
what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty
this shall assure my constant loyalty
that if our queen and this young prince agree
ill join mine eldest daughter and my joy
to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands
yes i agree and thank you for your motion
son edward she is fair and virtuous
therefore delay not give thy hand to warwick
and with thy hand thy faith irrevocable
that only warwicks daughter shall be thine
yes i accept her for she well deserves it
and here to pledge my vow i give my hand
why stay we now these soldiers shall be levied
and thou lord bourbon our high admiral
shalt waft them over with our royal fleet
i long till edward fall by wars mischance
for mocking marriage with a dame of france
i came from edward as ambassador
matter of marriage was the charge he gave me
but dreadful war shall answer his demand
had he none else to make a stale but me
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow
i was the chief that raised him to the crown
not that i pity henrys misery
but seek revenge on edwards mockery
3 king henry vi
now tell me brother clarence what think you
of this new marriage with the lady grey
hath not our brother made a worthy choice
alas you know tis far from hence to france
how could he stay till warwick made return
my lords forbear this talk here comes the king
and his wellchosen bride
i mind to tell him plainly what i think
now brother of clarence how like you our choice
that you stand pensive as half malcontent
as well as lewis of france or the earl of warwick
which are so weak of courage and in judgment
that theyll take no offence at our abuse
suppose they take offence without a cause
your king and warwicks and must have my will
yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well
yea brother richard are you offended too
no god forbid that i should wish them severd
whom god hath joind together ay and twere pity
to sunder them that yoke so well together
setting your scorns and your mislike aside
tell me some reason why the lady grey
should not become my wife and englands queen
and you too somerset and montague
speak freely what you think
becomes your enemy for mocking him
about the marriage of the lady bona
and warwick doing what you gave in charge
is now dishonoured by this new marriage
what if both lewis and warwick be appeased
by such invention as i can devise
yet to have joind with france in such alliance
would more have strengthend this our commonwealth
gainst foreign storms than any homebred marriage
why knows not montague that of itself
england is safe if true within itself
but the safer when tis backd with france
let us be backd with god and with the seas
which he hath given for fence impregnable
and with their helps only defend ourselves
in them and in ourselves our safety lies
for this one speech lord hastings well deserves
to have the heir of the lord hungerford
ay what of that it was my will and grant
and for this once my will shall stand for law
and yet methinks your grace hath not done well
to give the heir and daughter of lord scales
unto the brother of your loving bride
but in your bride you bury brotherhood
or else you would not have bestowd the heir
of the lord bonville on your new wifes son
and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere
alas poor clarence is it for a wife
that thou art malcontent i will provide thee
in choosing for yourself you showd your judgment
which being shallow you give me leave
to play the broker in mine own behalf
and to that end i shortly mind to leave you
leave me or tarry edward will be king
and not be tied unto his brothers will
my lords before it pleased his majesty
to raise my state to title of a queen
do me but right and you must all confess
that i was not ignoble of descent
and meaner than myself have had like fortune
but as this title honours me and mine
so your dislike to whom i would be pleasing
doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow
what danger or what sorrow can befall thee
so long as edward is thy constant friend
and their true sovereign whom they must obey
nay whom they shall obey and love thee too
unless they seek for hatred at my hands
which if they do yet will i keep thee safe
and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath
now messenger what letters or what news
from france
my sovereign liege no letters and few words
but such as i without your special pardon
dare not relate
tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them
what answer makes king lewis unto our letters
go tell false edward thy supposed king
that lewis of france is sending over masquers
to revel it with him and his new bride
is lewis so brave belike he thinks me henry
but what said lady bona to my marriage
tell him in hope hell prove a widower shortly
ill wear the willow garland for his sake
i blame not her she could say little less
she had the wrong but what said henrys queen
for i have heard that she was there in place
tell him quoth she my mourning weeds are done
and i am ready to put armour on
belike she minds to play the amazon
but what said warwick to these injuries
he more incensed against your majesty
tell him from me that he hath done me wrong
and therefore ill uncrown him eret be long
ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words
they shall have wars and pay for their presumption
but say is warwick friends with margaret
ay gracious sovereign they are so linkd in
friendship
that young prince edward marries warwicks daughter
belike the elder clarence will have the younger
now brother king farewell and sit you fast
for i will hence to warwicks other daughter
that though i want a kingdom yet in marriage
i may not prove inferior to yourself
you that love me and warwick follow me
clarence and somerset both gone to warwick
yet am i armd against the worst can happen
and haste is needful in this desperate case
pembroke and stafford you in our behalf
go levy men and make prepare for war
myself in person will straight follow you
but ere i go hastings and montague
resolve my doubt you twain of all the rest
tell me if you love warwick more than me
if it be so then both depart to him
but if you mind to hold your true obedience
give me assurance with some friendly vow
that i may never have you in suspect
so god help montague as he proves true
and hastings as he favours edwards cause
now brother richard will you stand by us
ay in despite of all that shall withstand you
why so then am i sure of victory
now therefore let us hence and lose no hour
till we meet warwick with his foreign power
3 king henry vi
trust me my lord all hitherto goes well
the common people by numbers swarm to us
but see where somerset and clarence come
speak suddenly my lords are we all friends
fear not that my lord
then gentle clarence welcome unto warwick
to rest mistrustful where a noble heart
hath pawnd an open hand in sign of love
else might i think that clarence edwards brother
but welcome sweet clarence my daughter shall be thine
and now what rests but in nights coverture
thy brother being carelessly encampd
his soldiers lurking in the towns about
and but attended by a simple guard
we may surprise and take him at our pleasure
that as ulysses and stout diomede
with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus tents
and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds
so we well coverd with the nights black mantle
at unawares may beat down edwards guard
and seize himself i say not slaughter him
for i intend but only to surprise him
you that will follow me to this attempt
applaud the name of henry with your leader
for warwick and his friends god and saint george
3 king henry vi
the king by this is set him down to sleep
what will he not to bed
why no for he hath made a solemn vow
never to lie and take his natural rest
till warwick or himself be quite suppressd
tomorrow then belike shall be the day
if warwick be so near as men report
but say i pray what nobleman is that
that with the king here resteth in his tent
tis the lord hastings the kings chiefest friend
o is it so but why commands the king
that his chief followers lodge in towns about him
while he himself keeps in the cold field
tis the more honour because more dangerous
ay but give me worship and quietness
i like it better than a dangerous honour
if warwick knew in what estate he stands
tis to be doubted he would waken him
unless our halberds did shut up his passage
ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent
but to defend his person from nightfoes
this is his tent and see where stand his guard
courage my masters honour now or never
but follow me and edward shall be ours
who goes there
stay or thou diest
what are they that fly there
the duke why warwick when we parted
thou calldst me king
when you disgraced me in my embassade
then i degraded you from being king
and come now to create you duke of york
alas how should you govern any kingdom
that know not how to use ambassadors
nor how to be contented with one wife
nor how to use your brothers brotherly
nor how to study for the peoples welfare
nor how to shroud yourself from enemies
yea brother of clarence are thou here too
nay then i see that edward needs must down
yet warwick in despite of all mischance
of thee thyself and all thy complices
though fortunes malice overthrow my state
my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel
but henry now shall wear the english crown
and be true king indeed thou but the shadow
my lord of somerset at my request
see that forthwith duke edward be conveyd
unto my brother archbishop of york
when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows
ill follow you and tell what answer
lewis and the lady bona send to him
now for a while farewell good duke of york
what fates impose that men must needs abide
it boots not to resist both wind and tide
what now remains my lords for us to do
but march to london with our soldiers
ay thats the first thing that we have to do
to free king henry from imprisonment
and see him seated in the regal throne
3 king henry vi
madam what makes you in this sudden change
why brother rivers are you yet to learn
what late misfortune is befalln king edward
what loss of some pitchd battle against warwick
no but the loss of his own royal person
then is my sovereign slain
ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner
either betrayd by falsehood of his guard
and as i further have to understand
is new committed to the bishop of york
fell warwicks brother and by that our foe
these news i must confess are full of grief
warwick may lose that now hath won the day
till then fair hope must hinder lifes decay
and i the rather wean me from despair
this is it that makes me bridle passion
and bear with mildness my misfortunes cross
ay ay for this i draw in many a tear
and stop the rising of bloodsucking sighs
lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown
king edwards fruit true heir to the english crown
but madam where is warwick then become
i am informd that he comes towards london
guess thou the rest king edwards friends must down
but to prevent the tyrants violence
for trust not him that hath once broken faith
ill hence forthwith unto the sanctuary
there shall i rest secure from force and fraud
if warwick take us we are sure to die
3 king henry vi
now my lord hastings and sir william stanley
leave off to wonder why i drew you hither
into this chiefest thicket of the park
is prisoner to the bishop here at whose hands
he hath good usage and great liberty
and often but attended with weak guard
comes hunting this way to disport himself
i have advertised him by secret means
that if about this hour he make his way
under the colour of his usual game
he shall here find his friends with horse and men
to set him free from his captivity
this way my lord for this way lies the game
now brother of gloucester lord hastings and the rest
stand you thus close to steal the bishops deer
your horse stands ready at the parkcorner
but whither shall we then
to lynn my lord
and ship from thence to flanders
well guessd believe me for that was my meaning
stanley i will requite thy forwardness
but wherefore stay we tis no time to talk
huntsman what sayst thou wilt thou go along
better do so than tarry and be hangd
come then away lets ha no more ado
and pray that i may repossess the crown
3 king henry vi
master lieutenant now that god and friends
have shaken edward from the regal seat
and turnd my captive state to liberty
my fear to hope my sorrows unto joys
at our enlargement what are thy due fees
subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns
but if an humble prayer may prevail
i then crave pardon of your majesty
for what lieutenant for well using me
nay be thou sure ill well requite thy kindness
for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure
ay such a pleasure as incaged birds
conceive when after many moody thoughts
at last by notes of household harmony
they quite forget their loss of liberty
but warwick after god thou setst me free
and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee
he was the author thou the instrument
therefore that i may conquer fortunes spite
by living low where fortune cannot hurt me
and that the people of this blessed land
may not be punishd with my thwarting stars
warwick although my head still wear the crown
i here resign my government to thee
for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds
your grace hath still been famed for virtuous
and now may seem as wise as virtuous
by spying and avoiding fortunes malice
yet in this one thing let me blame your grace
for choosing me when clarence is in place
no warwick thou art worthy of the sway
to whom the heavens in thy nativity
adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown
as likely to be blest in peace and war
and therefore i yield thee my free consent
and i choose clarence only for protector
now join your hands and with your hands your hearts
i make you both protectors of this land
while i myself will lead a private life
and in devotion spend my latter days
to sins rebuke and my creators praise
what answers clarence to his sovereigns will
that he consents if warwick yield consent
for on thy fortune i repose myself
well yoke together like a double shadow
to henrys body and supply his place
i mean in bearing weight of government
while he enjoys the honour and his ease
and clarence now then it is more than needful
forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor
and all his lands and goods be confiscate
what else and that succession be determined
ay therein clarence shall not want his part
but with the first of all your chief affairs
let me entreat for i command no more
that margaret your queen and my son edward
be sent for to return from france with speed
for till i see them here by doubtful fear
my joy of liberty is half eclipsed
it shall be done my sovereign with all speed
my lord of somerset what youth is that
of whom you seem to have so tender care
my liege it is young henry earl of richmond
come hither englands hope
if secret powers
suggest but truth to my divining thoughts
this pretty lad will prove our countrys bliss
his looks are full of peaceful majesty
his head by nature framed to wear a crown
his hand to wield a sceptre and himself
likely in time to bless a regal throne
make much of him my lords for this is he
must help you more than you are hurt by me
what news my friend
that edward is escaped from your brother
and fled as he hears since to burgundy
unsavoury news but how made he escape
he was conveyd by richard duke of gloucester
and the lord hastings who attended him
in secret ambush on the forest side
and from the bishops huntsmen rescued him
for hunting was his daily exercise
my brother was too careless of his charge
but let us hence my sovereign to provide
a salve for any sore that may betide
my lord i like not of this flight of edwards
for doubtless burgundy will yield him help
and we shall have more wars before t be long
as henrys late presaging prophecy
did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond
so doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts
therefore lord oxford to prevent the worst
forthwith well send him hence to brittany
till storms be past of civil enmity
ay for if edward repossess the crown
tis like that richmond with the rest shall down
it shall be so he shall to brittany
come therefore lets about it speedily
3 king henry vi
now brother richard lord hastings and the rest
yet thus far fortune maketh us amends
and says that once more i shall interchange
my waned state for henrys regal crown
well have we passd and now repassd the seas
what then remains we being thus arrived
from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york
but that we enter as into our dukedom
the gates made fast brother i like not this
for many men that stumble at the threshold
are well foretold that danger lurks within
by fair or foul means we must enter in
for hither will our friends repair to us
my liege ill knock once more to summon them
my lords we were forewarned of your coming
and shut the gates for safety of ourselves
for now we owe allegiance unto henry
but master mayor if henry be your king
yet edward at the least is duke of york
true my good lord i know you for no less
why and i challenge nothing but my dukedom
as being well content with that alone
why master mayor why stand you in a doubt
open the gates we are king henrys friends
ay say you so the gates shall then be opend
a wise stout captain and soon persuaded
the good old man would fain that all were well
so twere not long of him but being enterd
i doubt not i but we shall soon persuade
both him and all his brothers unto reason
but in the night or in the time of war
what fear not man but yield me up the keys
for edward will defend the town and thee
and all those friends that deign to follow me
brother this is sir john montgomery
our trusty friend unless i be deceived
welcome sir john but why come you in arms
to help king edward in his time of storm
as every loyal subject ought to do
thanks good montgomery but we now forget
our title to the crown and only claim
our dukedom till god please to send the rest
i came to serve a king and not a duke
drummer strike up and let us march away
nay stay sir john awhile and well debate
by what safe means the crown may be recoverd
what talk you of debating in few words
if youll not here proclaim yourself our king
ill leave you to your fortune and be gone
why shall we fight if you pretend no title
why brother wherefore stand you on nice points
till then tis wisdom to conceal our meaning
away with scrupulous wit now arms must rule
and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns
the bruit thereof will bring you many friends
then be it as you will for tis my right
and henry but usurps the diadem
ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself
and now will i be edwards champion
come fellowsoldier make thou proclamation
edward the fourth by the grace of god king of
england and france and lord of ireland c
and whosoeer gainsays king edwards right
by this i challenge him to single fight
long live edward the fourth
if fortune serve me ill requite this kindness
now for this night lets harbour here in york
and when the morning sun shall raise his car
above the border of this horizon
well forward towards warwick and his mates
for well i wot that henry is no soldier
ah froward clarence how evil it beseems thee
to flatter henry and forsake thy brother
yet as we may well meet both thee and warwick
and that once gotten doubt not of large pay
3 king henry vi
what counsel lords edward from belgia
with hasty germans and blunt hollanders
hath passd in safety through the narrow seas
and with his troops doth march amain to london
and many giddy people flock to him
lets levy men and beat him back again
a little fire is quickly trodden out
which being sufferd rivers cannot quench
in warwickshire i have truehearted friends
not mutinous in peace yet bold in war
shalt stir up in suffolk norfolk and in kent
thou brother montague in buckingham
northampton and in leicestershire shalt find
and thou brave oxford wondrous well beloved
in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends
my sovereign with the loving citizens
like to his island girt in with the ocean
or modest dian circled with her nymphs
shall rest in london till we come to him
fair lords take leave and stand not to reply
farewell my sovereign
farewell my hector and my troys true hope
in sign of truth i kiss your highness hand
wellminded clarence be thou fortunate
comfort my lord and so i take my leave
and thus i seal my truth and bid adieu
sweet oxford and my loving montague
and all at once once more a happy farewell
here at the palace i will rest awhile
cousin of exeter what thinks your lordship
methinks the power that edward hath in field
should not be able to encounter mine
the doubt is that he will seduce the rest
i have not stoppd mine ears to their demands
nor posted off their suits with slow delays
my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds
my mildness hath allayd their swelling griefs
my mercy dried their waterflowing tears
i have not been desirous of their wealth
nor much oppressd them with great subsidies
then why should they love edward more than me
and when the lion fawns upon the lamb
the lamb will never cease to follow him
hark hark my lord what shouts are these
seize on the shamefaced henry bear him hence
and once again proclaim us king of england
now stops thy spring my sea shal suck them dry
and swell so much the higher by their ebb
hence with him to the tower let him not speak
and lords towards coventry bend we our course
the sun shines hot and if we use delay
cold biting winter mars our hopedfor hay
away betimes before his forces join
brave warriors march amain towards coventry
3 king henry vi
where is the post that came from valiant oxford
how far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow
by this at dunsmore marching hitherward
how far off is our brother montague
where is the post that came from montague
by this at daintry with a puissant troop
say somerville what says my loving son
and by thy guess how nigh is clarence now
at southam i did leave him with his forces
and do expect him here some two hours hence
then clarence is at hand i hear his drum
the drum your honour hears marcheth from warwick
who should that be belike unlookdfor friends
they are at hand and you shall quickly know
go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle
see how the surly warwick mans the wall
o unbid spite is sportful edward come
where slept our scouts or how are they seduced
that we could hear no news of his repair
now warwick wilt thou ope the city gates
speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee
call edward king and at his hands beg mercy
and he shall pardon thee these outrages
nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence
confess who set thee up and pluckd thee own
call warwick patron and be penitent
and thou shalt still remain the duke of york
i thought at least he would have said the king
or did he make the jest against his will
is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift
ill do thee service for so good a gift
twas i that gave the kingdom to thy brother
why then tis mine if but by warwicks gift
and weakling warwick takes his gift again
and henry is my king warwick his subject
what is the body when the head is off
alas that warwick had no more forecast
but whiles he thought to steal the single ten
the king was slily fingerd from the deck
you left poor henry at the bishops palace
and ten to one youll meet him in the tower
tis even so yet you are warwick still
nay when strike now or else the iron cools
i had rather chop this hand off at a blow
and with the other fling it at thy face
than bear so low a sail to strike to thee
sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend
this hand fast wound about thy coalblack hair
shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off
write in the dust this sentence with thy blood
windchanging warwick now can change no more
o cheerful colours see where oxford comes
oxford oxford for lancaster
the gates are open let us enter too
so other foes may set upon our backs
stand we in good array for they no doubt
if not the city being but of small defence
well quickly rouse the traitors in the same
o welcome oxford for we want thy help
montague montague for lancaster
thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
even with the dearest blood your bodies bear
my mind presageth happy gain and conquest
somerset somerset for lancaster
two of thy name both dukes of somerset
have sold their lives unto the house of york
and thou shalt be the third if this sword hold
and lo where george of clarence sweeps along
of force enough to bid his brother battle
with whom an upright zeal to right prevails
more than the nature of a brothers love
come clarence come thou wilt if warwick call
father of warwick know you what this means
look here i throw my infamy at thee
i will not ruinate my fathers house
who gave his blood to lime the stones together
and set up lancaster why trowst thou warwick
that clarence is so harsh so blunt unnatural
to bend the fatal instruments of war
against his brother and his lawful king
to keep that oath were more impiety
than jephthahs when he sacrificed his daughter
i am so sorry for my trespass made
that to deserve well at my brothers hands
i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe
with resolution wheresoeer i meet thee
as i will meet thee if thou stir abroad
to plague thee for thy foul misleading me
and so proudhearted warwick i defy thee
and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks
and richard do not frown upon my faults
for i will henceforth be no more unconstant
now welcome more and ten times more beloved
than if thou never hadst deserved our hate
welcome good clarence this is brotherlike
o passing traitor perjured and unjust
what warwick wilt thou leave the town and fight
or shall we beat the stones about thine ears
alas i am not coopd here for defence
i will away towards barnet presently
and bid thee battle edward if thou darest
yes warwick edward dares and leads the way
lords to the field saint george and victory
3 king henry vi
for warwick was a bug that feard us all
now montague sit fast i seek for thee
that warwicks bones may keep thine company
ah who is nigh come to me friend or foe
and tell me who is victor york or warwick
why ask i that my mangled body shows
my blood my want of strength my sick heart shows
that i must yield my body to the earth
and by my fall the conquest to my foe
thus yields the cedar to the axes edge
whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle
under whose shade the ramping lion slept
whose topbranch overpeerd joves spreading tree
and kept low shrubs from winters powerful wind
these eyes that now are dimmd with deaths black veil
have been as piercing as the midday sun
the wrinkles in my brows now filled with blood
were likend oft to kingly sepulchres
for who lived king but i could dig his grave
and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow
lo now my glory smeard in dust and blood
my parks my walks my manors that i had
even now forsake me and of all my lands
is nothing left me but my bodys length
why what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust
and live we how we can yet die we must
ah warwick warwick wert thou as we are
we might recover all our loss again
why then i would not fly ah montague
if thou be there sweet brother take my hand
and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile
thou lovest me not for brother if thou didst
thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
that glues my lips and will not let me speak
come quickly montague or i am dead
ah warwick montague hath breathed his last
and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick
and said commend me to my valiant brother
and more he would have said and more he spoke
which sounded like a clamour in a vault
that mought not be distinguished but at last
i well might hear delivered with a groan
o farewell warwick
sweet rest his soul fly lords and save yourselves
for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven
away away to meet the queens great power
3 king henry vi
thus far our fortune keeps an upward course
and we are graced with wreaths of victory
but in the midst of this brightshining day
i spy a black suspicious threatening cloud
that will encounter with our glorious sun
i mean my lords those powers that the queen
hath raised in gallia have arrived our coast
and as we hear march on to fight with us
a little gale will soon disperse that cloud
the very beams will dry those vapours up
for every cloud engenders not a storm
the queen is valued thirty thousand strong
if she have time to breathe be well assured
her faction will be full as strong as ours
we are advertised by our loving friends
we having now the best at barnet field
will thither straight for willingness rids way
and as we march our strength will be augmented
in every county as we go along
strike up the drum cry courage and away
3 king henry vi
great lords wise men neer sit and wail their loss
but cheerly seek how to redress their harms
what though the mast be now blown overboard
the cable broke the holdinganchor lost
and half our sailors swallowd in the flood
yet lives our pilot still ist meet that he
should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
with tearful eyes add water to the sea
and give more strength to that which hath too much
whiles in his moan the ship splits on the rock
which industry and courage might have saved
ah what a shame ah what a fault were this
say warwick was our anchor what of that
and montague our topmost what of him
our slaughterd friends the tackles what of these
why is not oxford here another anchor
and somerset another goodly mast
the friends of france our shrouds and tacklings
and though unskilful why not ned and i
for once allowd the skilful pilots charge
we will not from the helm to sit and weep
but keep our course though the rough wind say no
from shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck
as good to chide the waves as speak them fair
and what is edward but ruthless sea
what clarence but a quicksand of deceit
and richard but a ragged fatal rock
all these the enemies to our poor bark
say you can swim alas tis but a while
bestride the rock the tide will wash you off
or else you famish thats a threefold death
this speak i lords to let you understand
if case some one of you would fly from us
that theres no hopedfor mercy with the brothers
more than with ruthless waves with sands and rocks
why courage then what cannot be avoided
twere childish weakness to lament or fear
methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
should if a coward heard her speak these words
infuse his breast with magnanimity
and make him naked foil a man at arms
i speak not this as doubting any here
for did i but suspect a fearful man
he should have leave to go away betimes
lest in our need he might infect another
and make him of like spirit to himself
if any such be hereas god forbid
let him depart before we need his help
women and children of so high a courage
and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame
o brave young prince thy famous grandfather
to bear his image and renew his glories
and he that will not fight for such a hope
go home to bed and like the owl by day
if he arise be mockd and wonderd at
thanks gentle somerset sweet oxford thanks
and take his thanks that yet hath nothing else
prepare you lords for edward is at hand
ready to fight therefore be resolute
to haste thus fast to find us unprovided
but hes deceived we are in readiness
this cheers my heart to see your forwardness
here pitch our battle hence we will not budge
brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood
which by the heavens assistance and your strength
must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night
i need not add more fuel to your fire
for well i wot ye blaze to burn them out
give signal to the fight and to it lords
lords knights and gentlemen what i should say
my tears gainsay for every word i speak
ye see i drink the water of mine eyes
is prisoner to the foe his state usurpd
his realm a slaughterhouse his subjects slain
his statutes cancelld and his treasure spent
and yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil
be valiant and give signal to the fight
3 king henry vi
now here a period of tumultuous broils
for somerset off with his guilty head
go bear them hence i will not hear them speak
for my part ill not trouble thee with words
nor i but stoop with patience to my fortune
so part we sadly in this troublous world
to meet with joy in sweet jerusalem
is proclamation made that who finds edward
shall have a high reward and he his life
bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak
what can so young a thorn begin to prick
edward what satisfaction canst thou make
for bearing arms for stirring up my subjects
and all the trouble thou hast turnd me to
speak like a subject proud ambitious york
suppose that i am now my fathers mouth
resign thy chair and where i stand kneel thou
whilst i propose the selfsame words to thee
which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to
ah that thy father had been so resolved
that you might still have worn the petticoat
and neer have stoln the breech from lancaster
let aesop fable in a winters night
his currish riddles sort not with this place
by heaven brat ill plague ye for that word
ay thou wast born to be a plague to men
for gods sake take away this captive scold
nay take away this scolding crookback rather
peace wilful boy or i will charm your tongue
untutord lad thou art too malapert
lascivious edward and thou perjured george
and thou misshapen dick i tell ye all
and thou usurpst my fathers right and mine
take that thou likeness of this railer here
sprawlst thou take that to end thy agony
and theres for twitting me with perjury
o kill me too
marry and shall
hold richard hold for we have done too much
why should she live to fill the world with words
what doth she swoon use means for her recovery
clarence excuse me to the king my brother
ere ye come there be sure to hear some news
what what
the tower the tower
o ned sweet ned speak to thy mother boy
canst thou not speak o traitors murderers
they that stabbd caesar shed no blood at all
did not offend nor were not worthy blame
and men neer spend their fury on a child
whats worse than murderer that i may name it
and i will speak that so my heart may burst
butchers and villains bloody cannibals
how sweet a plant have you untimely croppd
you have no children butchers if you had
but if you ever chance to have a child
look in his youth to have him so cut off
as deathmen you have rid this sweet young prince
away with her go bear her hence perforce
nay never bear me hence dispatch me here
what wilt thou not then clarence do it thou
by heaven i will not do thee so much ease
good clarence do sweet clarence do thou do it
didst thou not hear me swear i would not do it
twas sin before but now tis charity

hardfavourd richard richard where art thou
petitioners for blood thou neer putst back

so come to you and yours as to this prince
wheres richard gone

to make a bloody supper in the tower
hes sudden if a thing comes in his head
with pay and thanks and lets away to london
by this i hope she hath a son for me
3 king henry vi
good day my lord what at your book so hard
good gloucester and good devil were alike
and both preposterous therefore not good lord
so flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf
so first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
and next his throat unto the butchers knife
what scene of death hath roscius now to act
suspicion always haunts the guilty mind
the thief doth fear each bush an officer
the bird that hath been limed in a bush
with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush
and i the hapless male to one sweet bird
have now the fatal object in my eye
where my poor young was limed was caught and killd
why what a peevish fool was that of crete
that taught his son the office of a fowl
an yet for all his wings the fool was drownd
i daedalus my poor boy icarus
thy father minos that denied our course
the sun that seard the wings of my sweet boy
thy brother edward and thyself the sea
whose envious gulf did swallow up his life
ah kill me with thy weapon not with words
my breast can better brook thy daggers point
than can my ears that tragic history
but wherefore dost thou come ist for my life
thinkst thou i am an executioner
if murdering innocents be executing
why then thou art an executioner
thy son i killd for his presumption
hadst thou been killd when first thou didst presume
thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine
and thus i prophesy that many a thousand
which now mistrust no parcel of my fear
and many an old mans sigh and many a widows
and many an orphans waterstanding eye
men for their sons wives for their husbands
and orphans for their parents timeless death
shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born
the owl shriekd at thy birthan evil sign
the nightcrow cried aboding luckless time
dogs howld and hideous tempest shook down trees
the raven rookd her on the chimneys top
and chattering pies in dismal discords sung
thy mother felt more than a mothers pain
and yet brought forth less than a mothers hope
to wit an indigested and deformed lump
not like the fruit of such a goodly tree
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born
and if the rest be true which i have heard
thou camest
for this amongst the rest was i ordaind
ay and for much more slaughter after this
god forgive my sins and pardon thee
what will the aspiring blood of lancaster
sink in the ground i thought it would have mounted
see how my sword weeps for the poor kings death
o may such purple tears be alway shed
from those that wish the downfall of our house
if any spark of life be yet remaining
i that have neither pity love nor fear
indeed tis true that henry told me of
for i have often heard my mother say
had i not reason think ye to make haste
and seek their ruin that usurpd our right
the midwife wonderd and the women cried
o jesus bless us he is born with teeth
and so i was which plainly signified
that i should snarl and bite and play the dog
then since the heavens have shaped my body so
let hell make crookd my mind to answer it
i have no brother i am like no brother
and this word love which graybeards call divine
be resident in men like one another
but i will sort a pitchy day for thee
for i will buz abroad such prophecies
that edward shall be fearful of his life
and then to purge his fear ill be thy death
clarence thy turn is next and then the rest
counting myself but bad till i be best
ill throw thy body in another room
and triumph henry in thy day of doom
3 king henry vi
once more we sit in englands royal throne
repurchased with the blood of enemies
what valiant foemen like to autumns corn
have we mowd down in tops of all their pride
three dukes of somerset threefold renownd
for hardy and undoubted champions
two cliffords as the father and the son
and two northumberlands two braver men
neer spurrd their coursers at the trumpets sound
with them the two brave bears warwick and montague
that in their chains fetterd the kingly lion
and made the forest tremble when they roard
thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
and made our footstool of security
come hither bess and let me kiss my boy
young ned for thee thine uncles and myself
have in our armours watchd the winters night
went all afoot in summers scalding heat
that thou mightst repossess the crown in peace
and of our labours thou shalt reap the gain
clarence and gloucester love my lovely queen
and kiss your princely nephew brothers both
the duty that i owe unto your majesty
i seal upon the lips of this sweet babe
thanks noble clarence worthy brother thanks
and that i love the tree from whence thou sprangst
witness the loving kiss i give the fruit
now am i seated as my soul delights
having my countrys peace and brothers loves
what will your grace have done with margaret
reignier her father to the king of france
hath pawnd the sicils and jerusalem
and hither have they sent it for her ransom
away with her and waft her hence to france
and now what rests but that we spend the time
with stately triumphs mirthful comic shows
such as befits the pleasure of the court
sound drums and trumpets farewell sour annoy
for here i hope begins our lasting joy
if you shall chance camillo to visit bohemia on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot you shall see as i have said great
difference betwixt our bohemia and your sicilia
i think this coming summer the king of sicilia
means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him
wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves for indeed
beseech you
we cannot with such magnificencein so rarei know
not what to say we will give you sleepy drinks
that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience
may though they cannot praise us as little accuse
us
you pay a great deal too dear for whats given freely
believe me i speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance
sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia
they were trained together in their childhoods and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection
which cannot choose but branch now since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society their encounters
though not personal have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts letters loving
embassies that they have seemed to be together
though absent shook hands as over a vast and
embraced as it were from the ends of opposed
winds the heavens continue their loves
i think there is not in the world either malice or
matter to alter it you have an unspeakable
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note
is a gallant child one that indeed physics the
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a man
would they else be content to die
yes if there were no other excuse why they should
desire to live
if the king had no son they would desire to live
on crutches till he had one
nine changes of the watery star hath been
the shepherds note since we have left our throne
would be find up my brother with our thanks
and yet we should for perpetuity
yet standing in rich place i multiply
with one we thank you many thousands moe
that go before it
stay your thanks a while
and pay them when you part
sir thats tomorrow
i am questiond by my fears of what may chance
or breed upon our absence that may blow
no sneaping winds at home to make us say
to tire your royalty
we are tougher brother
than you can put us tot
no longer stay
one sevennight longer
very sooth tomorrow
well part the time betweens then and in that
ill no gainsaying
press me not beseech you so
there is no tongue that moves none none i the world
were there necessity in your request although
twere needful i denied it my affairs
were in your love a whip to me my stay
farewell our brother
tonguetied our queen
speak you
i had thought sir to have held my peace until
you have drawn oaths from him not to stay you sir
charge him too coldly tell him you are sure
all in bohemias well this satisfaction
hes beat from his best ward
well said hermione
but let him say so then and let him go
but let him swear so and he shall not stay
well thwack him hence with distaffs
yet of your royal presence ill adventure
the borrow of a week when at bohemia
you take my lord ill give him my commission
to let him there a month behind the gest
i love thee not a jar o the clock behind
what ladyshe her lord youll stay
no madam
nay but you will
i may not verily
verily
you put me off with limber vows but i
though you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths
should yet say sir no going verily
as potent as a lords will you go yet
force me to keep you as a prisoner
not like a guest so you shall pay your fees
when you depart and save your thanks how say you
my prisoner or my guest by your dread verily
one of them you shall be
to be your prisoner should import offending
which is for me less easy to commit
than you to punish
not your gaoler then
but your kind hostess come ill question you
you were pretty lordings then
we were fair queen
two lads that thought there was no more behind
but such a day tomorrow as today
and to be boy eternal
was not my lord
the verier wag o the two
we were as twinnd lambs that did frisk i the sun
was innocence for innocence we knew not
the doctrine of illdoing nor dreamd
that any did had we pursued that life
and our weak spirits neer been higher reard
with stronger blood we should have answerd heaven
boldly not guilty the imposition cleard
hereditary ours
by this we gather
you have trippd since
o my most sacred lady
temptations have since then been born tos for
in those unfledged days was my wife a girl
your precious self had then not crossd the eyes
of my young playfellow
grace to boot
of this make no conclusion lest you say
the offences we have made you do well answer
if you first sinnd with us and that with us
you did continue fault and that you slippd not
with any but with us
is he won yet
hell stay my lord
at my request he would not
hermione my dearest thou never spokest
to better purpose
never
never but once
what have i twice said well when wast before
i prithee tell me crams with praise and makes
slaughters a thousand waiting upon that
with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
what was my first it has an elder sister
nay let me havet i long
why that was when
three crabbed months had sourd themselves to death
ere i could make thee open thy white hand
i am yours for ever

the one for ever earnd a royal husband
the other for some while a friend
ay my good lord

and yet the steer the heifer and the calf
are all calld neatstill virginalling
upon his palmhow now you wanton calf
art thou my calf
yes if you will my lord
thou wantst a rough pash and the shoots that i have
almost as like as eggs women say so
that will say anything but were they false
as oerdyed blacks as wind as waters false
as dice are to be wishd by one that fixes
no bourn twixt his and mine yet were it true
to say this boy were like me come sir page
most dearst my collop can thy dammayt be
thou dost make possible things not so held
communicatest with dreamshow can this be
with whats unreal thou coactive art
thou mayst cojoin with something and thou dost
and that beyond commission and i find it
and that to the infection of my brains
and hardening of my brows
what means sicilia
he something seems unsettled
how my lord
what cheer how ist with you best brother
you look as if you held a brow of much distraction
are you moved my lord
no in good earnest
how sometimes nature will betray its folly
its tenderness and make itself a pastime
to harder bosoms looking on the lines
of my boys face methoughts i did recoil
twentythree years and saw myself unbreechd
in my green velvet coat my dagger muzzled
lest it should bite its master and so prove
how like methought i then was to this kernel
this squash this gentleman mine honest friend
will you take eggs for money
no my lord ill fight
you will why happy man bes dole my brother
are you so fond of your young prince as we
do seem to be of ours
if at home sir
hes all my exercise my mirth my matter
now my sworn friend and then mine enemy
he makes a julys day short as december
and with his varying childness cures in me
thoughts that would thick my blood
so stands this squire
and leave you to your graver steps hermione
how thou lovest us show in our brothers welcome
next to thyself and my young rover hes
apparent to my heart
if you would seek us
be you beneath the sky
i am angling now
though you perceive me not how i give line
go to go to
how she holds up the neb the bill to him
and arms her with the boldness of a wife
to her allowing husband
gone already
inchthick kneedeep oer head and
ears a forkd one
play too but so disgraced a part whose issue
will be my knell go play boy play
there have been
or i am much deceived cuckolds ere now
and many a man there is even at this present
now while i speak this holds his wife by the arm
that little thinks she has been sluiced ins absence
and his pond fishd by his next neighbour by
whiles other men have gates and those gates opend
as mine against their will should all despair
that have revolted wives the tenth of mankind
would hang themselves physic fort there is none
it is a bawdy planet that will strike
where tis predominant and tis powerful think it
no barricado for a belly knowt
it will let in and out the enemy
have the disease and feelt not how now boy
i am like you they say
why thats some comfort what camillo there
ay my good lord
go play mamillius thourt an honest man
camillo this great sir will yet stay longer
when you cast out it still came home
didst note it
his business more material
didst perceive it
theyre here with me already whispering rounding
when i shall gust it last how camet camillo
that he did stay
at the good queens entreaty
but so it is it is not was this taken
by any understanding pate but thine
for thy conceit is soaking will draw in
but of the finer natures by some severals
of headpiece extraordinary lower messes
perchance are to this business purblind say
business my lord i think most understand
bohemia stays here longer
ha
stays here longer
ay but why
to satisfy your highness and the entreaties
of our most gracious mistress
satisfy
the entreaties of your mistress satisfy
let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo
with all the nearest things to my heart as well
my chambercouncils wherein priestlike thou
hast cleansed my bosom i from thee departed
deceived in thy integrity deceived
in that which seems so
be it forbid my lord
to bide upont thou art not honest or
if thou inclinest that way thou art a coward
which hoxes honesty behind restraining
from course required or else thou must be counted
a servant grafted in my serious trust
and therein negligent or else a fool
that seest a game playd home the rich stake drawn
and takest it all for jest
my gracious lord
i may be negligent foolish and fearful
in every one of these no man is free
but that his negligence his folly fear
among the infinite doings of the world
sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord
if ever i were wilfulnegligent
it was my folly if industriously
i playd the fool it was my negligence
not weighing well the end if ever fearful
to do a thing where i the issue doubted
where of the execution did cry out
against the nonperformance twas a fear
are such allowd infirmities that honesty
is never free of but beseech your grace
be plainer with me let me know my trespass
tis none of mine
ha not you seen camillo
but thats past doubt you have or your eyeglass
is thicker than a cuckolds hornor heard
for to a vision so apparent rumour
cannot be muteor thoughtfor cogitation
resides not in that man that does not think
my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess
or else be impudently negative
to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say
my wifes a hobbyhorse deserves a name
as rank as any flaxwench that puts to
i would not be a standerby to hear
my sovereign mistress clouded so without
you never spoke what did become you less
than this which to reiterate were sin
as deep as that though true
is whispering nothing
is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses
kissing with inside lip stopping the career
of laughing with a sigha note infallible
of breaking honestyhorsing foot on foot
skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift
hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes
blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only
that would unseen be wicked is this nothing
why then the world and all thats int is nothing
the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing
my wife is nothing nor nothing have these nothings
if this be nothing
good my lord be cured
of this diseased opinion and betimes
for tis most dangerous
say it be tis true
no no my lord
i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee
pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave
or else a hovering temporizer that
canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil
infected as her life she would not live
the running of one glass
who does infect her
why he that wears her like a medal hanging
had servants true about me that bare eyes
to see alike mine honour as their profits
their own particular thrifts they would do that
his cupbearerwhom i from meaner form
have benched and reared to worship who mayst see
plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven
how i am galledmightst bespice a cup
to give mine enemy a lasting wink
which draught to me were cordial
sir my lord
i could do this and that with no rash potion
but with a lingering dram that should not work
believe this crack to be in my dread mistress
so sovereignly being honourable
i have loved thee
make that thy question and go rot
dost think i am so muddy so unsettled
to appoint myself in this vexation sully
the purity and whiteness of my sheets
which to preserve is sleep which being spotted
is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps
give scandal to the blood o the prince my son
who i do think is mine and love as mine
without ripe moving tot would i do this
could man so blench
i do and will fetch off bohemia fort
provided that when hes removed your highness
will take again your queen as yours at first
even for your sons sake and thereby for sealing
the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
known and allied to yours
thou dost advise me
ill give no blemish to her honour none
my lord
go then and with a countenance as clear
as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia
if from me he have wholesome beverage
account me not your servant
dot and thou hast the one half of my heart
dot not thou splitst thine own
ill dot my lord
i will seem friendly as thou hast advised me
o miserable lady but for me
what case stand i in i must be the poisoner
of good polixenes and my ground to dot
is the obedience to a master one
who in rebellion with himself will have
all that are his so too to do this deed
promotion follows if i could find example
of thousands that had struck anointed kings
and flourishd after ild not dot but since
nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one
let villany itself forsweart i must
to me a breakneck happy star reign now
here comes bohemia
my favour here begins to warp not speak
good day camillo
hail most royal sir
what is the news i the court
none rare my lord
the king hath on him such a countenance
as he had lost some province and a region
with customary compliment when he
wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
a lip of much contempt speeds from me and
so leaves me to consider what is breeding
that changeth thus his manners
i dare not know my lord
how dare not do not do you know and dare not
for to yourself what you do know you must
and cannot say you dare not good camillo
your changed complexions are to me a mirror
which shows me mine changed too for i must be
a party in this alteration finding
myself thus alterd with t
there is a sickness
which puts some of us in distemper but
i cannot name the disease and it is caught
of you that yet are well
how caught of me
i have lookd on thousands who have sped the better
by my regard but killd none so camillo
as you are certainly a gentleman thereto
clerklike experienced which no less adorns
our gentry than our parents noble names
in whose success we are gentlei beseech you
if you know aught which does behove my knowledge
thereof to be informd imprisont not
in ignorant concealment
i may not answer
a sickness caught of me and yet i well
i must be answerd dost thou hear camillo
i conjure thee by all the parts of man
which honour does acknowledge whereof the least
is not this suit of mine that thou declare
what incidency thou dost guess of harm
is creeping toward me how far off how near
which way to be prevented if to be
if not how best to bear it
sir i will tell you
since i am charged in honour and by him
which must be even as swiftly followd as
i mean to utter it or both yourself and me
cry lost and so good night
on good camillo
i am appointed him to murder you
by whom camillo
by the king
for what
he thinks nay with all confidence he swears
as he had seent or been an instrument
to vice you tot that you have touchd his queen
forbiddenly
o then my best blood turn
to an infected jelly and my name
be yoked with his that did betray the best
turn then my freshest reputation to
a savour that may strike the dullest nostril
where i arrive and my approach be shunnd
nay hated too worse than the greatst infection
that eer was heard or read
swear his thought over
by each particular star in heaven and
by all their influences you may as well
forbid the sea for to obey the moon
as or by oath remove or counsel shake
the fabric of his folly whose foundation
is piled upon his faith and will continue
the standing of his body
how should this grow
avoid whats grown than question how tis born
if therefore you dare trust my honesty
that lies enclosed in this trunk which you
shall bear along impawnd away tonight
your followers i will whisper to the business
and will by twos and threes at several posterns
clear them o the city for myself ill put
my fortunes to your service which are here
by this discovery lost be not uncertain
for by the honour of my parents i
i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer
than one condemnd by the kings own mouth thereon
his execution sworn
be pilot to me and thy places shall
still neighbour mine my ships are ready and
my people did expect my hence departure
two days ago this jealousy
must it be great and as his persons mighty
must it be violent and as he does conceive
he is dishonourd by a man which ever
professd to him why his revenges must
good expedition be my friend and comfort
the gracious queen part of his theme but nothing
of his illtaen suspicion come camillo
i will respect thee as a father if
it is in mine authority to command
to take the urgent hour come sir away
tis past enduring
come my gracious lord
shall i be your playfellow
no ill none of you
why my sweet lord
youll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
i were a baby still i love you better
and why so my lord
not for because
your brows are blacker yet black brows they say
become some women best so that there be not
too much hair there but in a semicircle
or a halfmoon made with a pen
who taught you this
i learnt it out of womens faces pray now
what colour are your eyebrows
blue my lord
that has been blue but not her eyebrows
hark ye
present our services to a fine new prince
one of these days and then yould wanton with us
if we would have you
she is spread of late
what wisdom stirs amongst you come sir now
and tell s a tale
merry or sad shallt be
as merry as you will
of sprites and goblins
lets have that good sir
to fright me with your sprites youre powerful at it
there was a man
nay come sit down then on
yond crickets shall not hear it
come on then
and givet me in mine ear
was he met there his train camillo with him
behind the tuft of pines i met them never
even to their ships
how blest am i
in my just censure in my true opinion
alack for lesser knowledge how accursed
in being so blest there may be in the cup
a spider steepd and one may drink depart
and yet partake no venom for his knowledge
the abhorrd ingredient to his eye make known
how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides
with violent hefts i have drunk
and seen the spider
there is a plot against my life my crown
he has discoverd my design and i
remain a pinchd thing yea a very trick
for them to play at will how came the posterns
so easily open
by his great authority
which often hath no less prevaild than so
on your command
i knowt too well
though he does bear some signs of me yet you
have too much blood in him
what is this sport
bear the boy hence he shall not come about her
away with him and let her sport herself
with that shes big with for tis polixenes
has made thee swell thus
but ild say he had not
and ill be sworn you would believe my saying
howeer you lean to the nayward
you my lords
look on her mark her well be but about
to say she is a goodly lady and
the justice of your bearts will thereto add
praise her but for this her withoutdoor form
which on my faith deserves high speech and straight
the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands
that calumny doth useo i am out
that mercy does for calumny will sear
when you have said shes goodly come between
from him that has most cause to grieve it should be
shes an adulteress
should a villain say so
the most replenishd villain in the world
do but mistake
you have mistook my lady
which ill not call a creature of thy place
lest barbarism making me the precedent
should a like language use to all degrees
and mannerly distinguishment leave out
more shes a traitor and camillo is
a federary with her and one that knows
what she should shame to know herself
but with her most vile principal that shes
a bedswerver even as bad as those
that vulgars give boldst titles ay and privy
to this their late escape
no by my life
privy to none of this how will this grieve you
when you shall come to clearer knowledge that
you thus have publishd me gentle my lord
you scarce can right me throughly then to say
you did mistake
no if i mistake
in those foundations which i build upon
the centre is not big enough to bear
a schoolboys top away with her to prison
he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
but that he speaks
i must be patient till the heavens look
with an aspect more favourable good my lords
i am not prone to weeping as our sex
commonly are the want of which vain dew
that honourable grief lodged here which burns
with thoughts so qualified as your charities
shall best instruct you measure me and so
the kings will be performd
shall i be heard
who ist that goes with me beseech your highness
my women may be with me for you see
my plight requires it do not weep good fools
has deserved prison then abound in tears
i never wishd to see you sorry now
i trust i shall my women come you have leave
go do our bidding hence
beseech your highness call the queen again
be certain what you do sir lest your justice
prove violence in the which three great ones suffer
yourself your queen your son
for her my lord
i dare my life lay down and will dot sir
please you to accept it that the queen is spotless
i the eyes of heaven and to you i mean
in this which you accuse her
if it prove
shes otherwise ill keep my stables where
i lodge my wife ill go in couples with her
than when i feel and see her no farther trust her
for every inch of woman in the world
ay every dram of womans flesh is false if she be
hold your peaces
good my lord
you are abused and by some putteron
that will be damnd fort would i knew the villain
i would landdamn him be she honourflawd
i have three daughters the eldest is eleven
the second and the third nine and some five
by mine honour
ill geld em all fourteen they shall not see
and i had rather glib myself than they
should not produce fair issue
cease no more
you smell this business with a sense as cold
as you feel doing thus and see withal
the instruments that feel
if it be so
theres not a grain of it the face to sweeten
of the whole dungy earth
what lack i credit
i had rather you did lack than i my lord
upon this ground and more it would content me
to have her honour true than your suspicion
be blamed fort how you might
why what need we
commune with you of this but rather follow
our forceful instigation our prerogative
calls not your counsels but our natural goodness
imparts this which if you or stupefied
or seeming so in skill cannot or will not
relish a truth like us inform yourselves
the loss the gain the ordering ont is all
properly ours
and i wish my liege
you had only in your silent judgment tried it
without more overture
how could that be
either thou art most ignorant by age
or thou wert born a fool camillos flight
added to their familiarity
which was as gross as ever touchd conjecture
that lackd sight only nought for approbation
but only seeing all other circumstances
yet for a greater confirmation
for in an act of this importance twere
most piteous to be wild i have dispatchd in post
to sacred delphos to apollos temple
cleomenes and dion whom you know
they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had
shall stop or spur me have i done well
well done my lord
though i am satisfied and need no more
than what i know yet shall the oracle
give rest to the minds of others such as he
whose ignorant credulity will not
come up to the truth so have we thought it good
from our free person she should be confined
lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
be left her to perform come follow us
we are to speak in public for this business
will raise us all
the keeper of the prison call to him
let him have knowledge who i am
good lady
no court in europe is too good for thee
what dost thou then in prison
now good sir
you know me do you not
for a worthy lady
and one whom much i honour

the access of gentle visitors

shall bring emilia forth

withdraw yourselves

which never tender lady hath born greater

a boy
a daughter and a goodly babe
much comfort int says my poor prisoner
i am innocent as you
i dare be sworn
these dangerous unsafe lunes i the king
beshrew them
if i prove honeymouthd let my tongue blister
and never to my redlookd anger be
the trumpet any more pray you emilia
if she dares trust me with her little babe
ill showt the king and undertake to be
her advocate to the loudst we do not know
the silence often of pure innocence
persuades when speaking fails
most worthy madam
your honour and your goodness is so evident
that your free undertaking cannot miss
so meet for this great errand please your ladyship
to visit the next room ill presently
acquaint the queen of your most noble offer
who but today hammerd of this design
but durst not tempt a minister of honour
lest she should be denied
tell her emilia
as boldness from my bosom let t not be doubted
i shall do good
now be you blest for it
come something nearer
madam ift please the queen to send the babe
i know not what i shall incur to pass it
having no warrant
this child was prisoner to the womb and is
by law and process of great nature thence
freed and enfranchised not a party to
the anger of the king nor guilty of
if any be the trespass of the queen
i do believe it
i will stand betwixt you and danger
to bear the matter thus mere weakness if
the cause were not in beingpart o the cause
she the adulteress for the harlot king
is quite beyond mine arm out of the blank
and level of my brain plotproof but she
given to the fire a moiety of my rest
might come to me again whos there
my lord
how does the boy
he took good rest tonight
tis hoped his sickness is discharged
to see his nobleness
conceiving the dishonour of his mother
he straight declined droopd took it deeply
fastend and fixd the shame ont in himself
threw off his spirit his appetite his sleep
see how he fares
the thought of my revenges that way
and in his parties his alliance let him be
take it on her camillo and polixenes
they should not laugh if i could reach them nor
shall she within my power
you must not enter
fear you his tyrannous passion more alas
than the queens life a gracious innocent soul
more free than he is jealous
thats enough
madam he hath not slept tonight commanded
none should come at him
i come to bring him sleep tis such as you
that creep like shadows by him and do sigh
at each his needless heavings such as you
do come with words as medicinal as true
honest as either to purge him of that humour
that presses him from sleep
what noise there ho
no noise my lord but needful conference
about some gossips for your highness
how
away with that audacious lady antigonus
i knew she would
i told her so my lord
on your displeasures peril and on mine
she should not visit you
what canst not rule her
unless he take the course that you have done
commit me for committing honour trust it
he shall not rule me
when she will take the rein i let her run
but shell not stumble
good my liege i come
and i beseech you hear me who profess
myself your loyal servant your physician
your most obedient counsellor yet that dare
less appear so in comforting your evils
from your good queen
good queen

but first ill do my errand the good queen
for she is good hath brought you forth a daughter
here tis commends it to your blessing

traitors

thou dotard thou art womantired unroosted
by thy dame partlet here take up the bastard
taket up i say givet to thy crone

which he has put upont
he dreads his wife
so i would you did then twere past all doubt
yould call your children yours
a nest of traitors
i am none by this good light
nor i nor any
but one thats here and thats himself for he
the sacred honour of himself his queens
his hopeful sons his babes betrays to slander
whose sting is sharper than the swords
and will not
for as the case now stands it is a curse
he cannot be compelld totonce remove
the root of his opinion which is rotten
as ever oak or stone was sound
a callat
of boundless tongue who late hath beat her husband
and now baits me this brat is none of mine
hence with it and together with the dam
commit them to the fire
it is yours
and might we lay the old proverb to your charge
so like you tis the worse behold my lords
although the print be little the whole matter
and copy of the father eye nose lip
the trick ofs frown his forehead nay the valley
the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek
his smiles
and thou good goddess nature which hast made it
so like to him that got it if thou hast
the ordering of the mind too mongst all colours
no yellow int lest she suspect as he does
her children not her husbands
a gross hag
and lozel thou art worthy to be hangd
that wilt not stay her tongue
hang all the husbands
that cannot do that feat youll leave yourself
hardly one subject
once more take her hence
a most unworthy and unnatural lord
can do no more
ill ha thee burnt
it is an heretic that makes the fire
not she which burns int ill not call you tyrant
but this most cruel usage of your queen
not able to produce more accusation
than your own weakhinged fancy something savours
of tyranny and will ignoble make you
yea scandalous to the world
on your allegiance
out of the chamber with her were i a tyrant
where were her life she durst not call me so
if she did know me one away with her
i pray you do not push me ill be gone
jove send her
a better guiding spirit what needs these hands

a heart so tender oer it take it hence
and see it instantly consumed with fire
within this hour bring me word tis done
and by good testimony or ill seize thy life
with what thou else callst thine if thou refuse
and wilt encounter with my wrath say so
the bastard brains with these my proper hands
shall i dash out go take it to the fire
for thou setst on thy wife
these lords my noble fellows if they please
can clear me int
he is not guilty of her coming hither
youre liars all
we have always truly served you and beseech you
so to esteem of us and on our knees we beg
as recompense of our dear services
past and to come that you do change this purpose
which being so horrible so bloody must
shall i live on to see this bastard kneel
and call me father better burn it now
than curse it then but be it let it live

you that have been so tenderly officious
with lady margery your midwife there
to save this bastards lifefor tis a bastard
so sure as this beards grey
what will you adventure
to save this brats life

that my ability may undergo
ill pawn the little blood which i have left
it shall be possible swear by this sword
thou wilt perform my bidding
i will my lord
mark and perform it seest thou for the fail
of any point int shall not only be
death to thyself but to thy lewdtongued wife
whom for this time we pardon we enjoin thee
as thou art liegeman to us that thou carry
this female bastard hence and that thou bear it
to some remote and desert place quite out
of our dominions and that there thou leave it
without more mercy to its own protection
and favour of the climate as by strange fortune
it came to us i do in justice charge thee
on thy souls peril and thy bodys torture
that thou commend it strangely to some place
where chance may nurse or end it take it up
i swear to do this though a present death
some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
to be thy nurses wolves and bears they say
casting their savageness aside have done
like offices of pity sir be prosperous
in more than this deed does require and blessing
against this cruelty fight on thy side
poor thing condemnd to loss
no ill not rear
anothers issue
please your highness posts
from those you sent to the oracle are come
being well arrived from delphos are both landed
hasting to the court
so please you sir their speed
hath been beyond account
twentythree days
the great apollo suddenly will have
the truth of this appear prepare you lords
summon a session that we may arraign
our most disloyal lady for as she hath
been publicly accused so shall she have
a just and open trial while she lives
my heart will be a burthen to me leave me
and think upon my bidding
the climates delicate the air most sweet
fertile the isle the temple much surpassing
the common praise it bears
i shall report
for most it caught me the celestial habits
methinks i so should term them and the reverence
of the grave wearers o the sacrifice
how ceremonious solemn and unearthly
it was i the offering
but of all the burst
and the eardeafening voice o the oracle
kin to joves thunder so surprised my sense
that i was nothing
if the event o the journey
prove as successful to the queeno bet so
as it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy
the time is worth the use ont
great apollo
turn all to the best these proclamations
so forcing faults upon hermione
i little like
the violent carriage of it
thus by apollos great divine seald up
shall the contents discover something rare
and gracious be the issue
this sessions to our great grief we pronounce
the daughter of a king our wife and one
of us too much beloved let us be cleard
of being tyrannous since we so openly
proceed in justice which shall have due course
even to the guilt or the purgation
produce the prisoner
it is his highness pleasure that the queen
appear in person here in court silence
read the indictment
since what i am to say must be but that
which contradicts my accusation and
the testimony on my part no other
but what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me
being counted falsehood shall as i express it
behold our human actions as they do
i doubt not then but innocence shall make
false accusation blush and tyranny
tremble at patience you my lord best know
who least will seem to do so my past life
hath been as continent as chaste as true
as i am now unhappy which is more
than history can pattern though devised
and playd to take spectators for behold me
a fellow of the royal bed which owe
a moiety of the throne a great kings daughter
the mother to a hopeful prince here standing
to prate and talk for life and honour fore
who please to come and hear for life i prize it
tis a derivative from me to mine
and only that i stand for i appeal
to your own conscience sir before polixenes
came to your court how i was in your grace
how merited to be so since he came
with what encounter so uncurrent i
the bound of honour or in act or will
that way inclining hardend be the hearts
of all that hear me and my nearst of kin
cry fie upon my grave
i neer heard yet
that any of these bolder vices wanted
less impudence to gainsay what they did
than to perform it first
thats true enough
through tis a saying sir not due to me
you will not own it
more than mistress of
which comes to me in name of fault i must not
at all acknowledge for polixenes
with whom i am accused i do confess
i loved him as in honour he required
with such a kind of love as might become
a lady like me with a love even such
which not to have done i think had been in me
both disobedience and ingratitude
to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke
even since it could speak from an infant freely
that it was yours now for conspiracy
i know not how it tastes though it be dishd
is that camillo was an honest man
and why he left your court the gods themselves
wotting no more than i are ignorant
you knew of his departure as you know
what you have undertaen to do ins absence
sir
my life stands in the level of your dreams
which ill lay down
your actions are my dreams
you had a bastard by polixenes
and i but dreamd it as you were past all shame
which to deny concerns more than avails for as
thy brat hath been cast out like to itself
no father owning itwhich is indeed
more criminal in thee than itso thou
shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage
look for no less than death
the bug which you would fright me with i seek
the crown and comfort of my life your favour
i do give lost for i do feel it gone
but know not how it went my second joy
and firstfruits of my body from his presence
i am barrd like one infectious my third comfort
starrd most unluckily is from my breast
the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth
the childbed privilege denied which longs
to women of all fashion lastly hurried
here to this place i the open air before
i have got strength of limit now my liege
tell me what blessings i have here alive
that i should fear to die therefore proceed
i prize it not a straw but for mine honour
which i would free if i shall be condemnd
upon surmises all proofs sleeping else
but what your jealousies awake i tell you
tis rigor and not law your honours all
apollo be my judge
this your request
and in apollos name his oracle
o that he were alive and here beholding
his daughters trial that he did but see
the flatness of my misery yet with eyes
of pity not revenge
you here shall swear upon this sword of justice
that you cleomenes and dion have
been both at delphos and from thence have brought
the sealdup oracle by the hand deliverd
of great apollos priest and that since then
you have not dared to break the holy seal
nor read the secrets int
all this we swear
break up the seals and read
now blessed be the great apollo
praised
hast thou read truth
ay my lord even so
as it is here set down
my lord the king the king
what is the business
o sir i shall be hated to report it
the prince your son with mere conceit and fear
of the queens speed is gone
how gone
is dead
apollos angry and the heavens themselves
do strike at my injustice
how now there
and see what death is doing
beseech you tenderly apply to her
some remedies for life
apollo pardon
my great profaneness gainst thine oracle
ill reconcile me to polixenes
new woo my queen recall the good camillo
whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy
for being transported by my jealousies
to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose
camillo for the minister to poison
but that the good mind of camillo tardied
my swift command though i with death and with
reward did threaten and encourage him
and filld with honour to my kingly guest
unclaspd my practise quit his fortunes here
which you knew great and to the hazard
of all encertainties himself commended
thorough my rust and how his pity
does my deeds make the blacker
woe the while
o cut my lace lest my heart cracking it
break too
what fit is this good lady
what studied torments tyrant hast for me
what wheels racks fires what flaying boiling
in leads or oils what old or newer torture
must i receive whose every word deserves
to taste of thy most worst thy tyranny
together working with thy jealousies
fancies too weak for boys too green and idle
for girls of nine o think what they have done
and then run mad indeed stark mad for all
thy bygone fooleries were but spices of it
that thou betraydst polixenestwas nothing
that did but show thee of a fool inconstant
thou wouldst have poisond good camillos honour
the casting forth to crows thy babydaughter
to be or none or little though a devil
nor ist directly laid to thee the death
of the young prince whose honourable thoughts
thoughts high for one so tender cleft the heart
that could conceive a gross and foolish sire
when i have said cry woe the queen the queen
the sweetst dearst creatures dead
and vengeance fort
not droppd down yet
the higher powers forbid
i say shes dead ill sweart if word nor oath
tincture or lustre in her lip her eye
heat outwardly or breath within ill serve you
as i would do the gods but o thou tyrant
do not repent these things for they are heavier
than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee
to nothing but despair a thousand knees
ten thousand years together naked fasting
upon a barren mountain and still winter
in storm perpetual could not move the gods
to look that way thou wert
go on go on
thou canst not speak too much i have deserved
all tongues to talk their bitterest
howeer the business goes you have made fault
i the boldness of your speech
all faults i make when i shall come to know them
i do repent alas i have showd too much
to the noble heart whats gone and whats past help
at my petition i beseech you rather
let me be punishd that have minded you
of what you should forget now good my liege
the love i bore your queenlo fool again
ill speak of her no more nor of your children
ill not remember you of my own lord
and ill say nothing
thou didst speak but well
when most the truth which i receive much better
than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me
the causes of their death appear unto
our shame perpetual once a day ill visit
the chapel where they lie and tears shed there
will bear up with this exercise so long
i daily vow to use it come and lead me
unto these sorrows
thou art perfect then our ship hath touchd upon
the deserts of bohemia
and threaten present blusters in my conscience
the heavens with that we have in hand are angry
and frown upon s
their sacred wills be done go get aboard
i call upon thee
make your best haste and go not
besides this place is famous for the creatures
of prey that keep upont
ill follow instantly
i am glad at heart
to be so rid o the business
i have heard but not believed
the spirits o the dead
appeard to me last night for neer was dream
so like a waking to me comes a creature
sometimes her head on one side some another
i never saw a vessel of like sorrow
like very sanctity she did approach
my cabin where i lay thrice bowd before me
and gasping to begin some speech her eyes
since fate against thy better disposition
hath made thy person for the throwerout
of my poor babe according to thine oath
places remote enough are in bohemia
there weep and leave it crying and for the babe
is counted lost for ever perdita
i prithee callt for this ungentle business
put on thee by my lord thou neer shalt see
thy wife paulina more and so with shrieks
she melted into air affrighted much
i did in time collect myself and thought
yet for this once yea superstitiously
i will be squared by this i do believe
hermione hath sufferd death and that
apollo would this being indeed the issue
of king polixenes it should here be laid
either for life or death upon the earth
of its right father blossom speed thee well
which may if fortune please both breed thee pretty
and still rest thine the storm begins poor wretch
that for thy mothers fault art thus exposed
to loss and what may follow weep i cannot
but my heart bleeds and most accursed am i
to be by oath enjoind to this farewell
the heavens so dim by day a savage clamour
i am gone for ever
i would there were no age between sixteen and
threeandtwenty or that youth would sleep out the
rest for there is nothing in the between but
getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry
stealing fightinghark you now would any but
these boiled brains of nineteen and twoandtwenty
hunt this weather they have scared away two of my
best sheep which i fear the wolf will sooner find
the seaside browsing of ivy good luck ant be thy
will what have we here mercy on s a barne a very
pretty barne a boy or a child i wonder a

but even now whoa ho hoa

what art so near if thoult see a thing to talk
on when thou art dead and rotten come hither what
ailest thou man
i have seen two such sights by sea and by land
but i am not to say it is a sea for it is now the
a bodkins point
why boy how is it
i would you did but see how it chafes how it rages
how it takes up the shore but thats not the
point o the most piteous cry of the poor souls
sometimes to see em and not to see em now the
ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon
swallowed with yest and froth as yould thrust a
cork into a hogshead and then for the
landservice to see how the bear tore out his
shoulderbone how he cried to me for help and said
his name was antigonus a nobleman but to make an
end of the ship to see how the sea flapdragoned
sea mocked them and how the poor gentleman roared
and the bear mocked him both roaring louder than
the sea or weather
name of mercy when was this boy
now
would i had been by to have helped the old man
i would you had been by the ship side to have
heavy matters heavy matters but look thee here
dying i with things newborn heres a sight for

which is left of him what he is fetch me to the
sight of him
marry will i and you shall help to put him i the ground
tis a lucky day boy and well do good deeds ont
i that please some try all both joy and terror
of good and bad that makes and unfolds error
now take upon me in the name of time
to use my wings impute it not a crime
to me or my swift passage that i slide
oer sixteen years and leave the growth untried
of that wide gap since it is in my power
to oerthrow law and in one selfborn hour
to plant and oerwhelm custom let me pass
the same i am ere ancientst order was
the times that brought them in so shall i do
to the freshest things now reigning and make stale
the glistering of this present as my tale
now seems to it your patience this allowing
i turn my glass and give my scene such growing
the effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
that he shuts up himself imagine me
gentle spectators that i now may be
in fair bohemia and remember well
i mentioned a son o the kings which florizel
i now name to you and with speed so pace
to speak of perdita now grown in grace
i list not prophecy but let times news
be known when tis brought forth
a shepherds daughter
and what to her adheres which follows after
is the argument of time of this allow
if ever you have spent time worse ere now
if never yet that time himself doth say
he wishes earnestly you never may
tis a sickness denying thee any thing a death to
grant this
i have for the most part been aired abroad i
desire to lay my bones there besides the penitent
king my master hath sent for me to whose feeling
sorrows i might be some allay or i oerween to
think so which is another spur to my departure
as thou lovest me camillo wipe not out the rest of
thee thine own goodness hath made better not to
made me businesses which none without thee can
sufficiently manage must either stay to execute
them thyself or take away with thee the very
services thou hast done which if i have not enough
considered as too much i cannot to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit
therein the heaping friendships of that fatal
country sicilia prithee speak no more whose very
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
penitent as thou callest him and reconciled king
my brother whose loss of his most precious queen
and children are even now to be afresh lamented
say to me when sawest thou the prince florizel my
son kings are no less unhappy their issue not
being gracious than they are in losing them when
they have approved their virtues
sir it is three days since i saw the prince what
have missingly noted he is of late much retired
from court and is less frequent to his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared
i have considered so much camillo and with some
care so far that i have eyes under my service which
look upon his removedness from whom i have this
intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a
most homely shepherd a man they say that from
very nothing and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate
i have heard sir of such a man who hath a
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage
thats likewise part of my intelligence but i
fear the angle that plucks our son thither thou
shalt accompany us to the place where we will not
appearing what we are have some question with the
shepherd from whose simplicity i think it not
uneasy to get the cause of my sons resort thither
prithee be my present partner in this business and
lay aside the thoughts of sicilia
i willingly obey your command
my best camillo we must disguise ourselves
when daffodils begin to peer
with heigh the doxy over the dale
why then comes in the sweet o the year
for the red blood reigns in the winters pale
the white sheet bleaching on the hedge
with heigh the sweet birds o how they sing
doth set my pugging tooth on edge
for a quart of ale is a dish for a king
the lark that tirralyra chants
with heigh with heigh the thrush and the jay
are summer songs for me and my aunts
while we lie tumbling in the hay
i have served prince florizel and in my time
but shall i go mourn for that my dear
and when i wander here and there
i then do most go right
if tinkers may have leave to live
and bear the sowskin budget
then my account i well may give
and in the stocks avouch it
my traffic is sheets when the kite builds look to
lesser linen my father named me autolycus who
being as i am littered under mercury was likewise
a snapperup of unconsidered trifles with die and
drab i purchased this caparison and my revenue is
the silly cheat gallows and knock are too powerful
of it a prize a prize
yields pound and odd shilling fifteen hundred
shorn what comes the wool to
i cannot dot without counters let me see what am
i to buy for our sheepshearing feast three pound
of sugar five pound of currants ricewhat will
this sister of mine do with rice but my father
hath made her mistress of the feast and she lays it
on she hath made me four and twenty nosegays for
the shearers threemansongmen all and very good
ones but they are most of them means and bases but
one puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to
hornpipes i must have saffron to colour the warden
pies mace datesnone thats out of my note
nutmegs seven a race or two of ginger but that i
may beg four pound of prunes and as many of
raisins o the sun
o that ever i was born
i the name of me
o help me help me pluck but off these rags and
then death death
alack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay
on thee rather than have these off
o sir the loathsomeness of them offends me more
than the stripes i have received which are mighty
ones and millions
alas poor man a million of beating may come to a
great matter
i am robbed sir and beaten my money and apparel
taen from me and these detestable things put upon
me
what by a horseman or a footman
a footman sweet sir a footman
indeed he should be a footman by the garments he
it hath seen very hot service lend me thy hand
o good sir tenderly o
alas poor soul
o good sir softly good sir i fear sir my
shoulderblade is out
how now canst stand
dost lack any money i have a little money for thee
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence
unto whom i was going i shall there have money or
that kills my heart
what manner of fellow was he that robbed you
a fellow sir that i have known to go about with
trollmydames i knew him once a servant of the
virtues it was but he was certainly whipped out of the court
his vices you would say theres no virtue whipped
there and yet it will no more but abide
hath been since an apebearer then a
processserver a bailiff then he compassed a
motion of the prodigal son and married a tinkers
wife within a mile where my land and living lies
and having flown over many knavish professions he
wakes fairs and bearbaitings
very true sir he sir he thats the rogue that
put me into this apparel
but looked big and spit at him held have run
false of heart that way and that he knew i warrant
him
how do you now
sweet sir much better than i was i can stand and
softly towards my kinsmans
shall i bring thee on the way
no goodfaced sir no sweet sir
sheepshearing
prosper you sweet sir
your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice
make not this cheat bring out another and the
shearers prove sheep let me be unrolled and my name
put in the book of virtue
jog on jog on the footpath way
a merry heart goes all the day
your sad tires in a milea
these your unusual weeds to each part of you
peering in aprils front this your sheepshearing
is as a meeting of the petty gods
and you the queen ont
sir my gracious lord
o pardon that i name them your high self
the gracious mark o the land you have obscured
with a swains wearing and me poor lowly maid
in every mess have folly and the feeders
digest it with a custom i should blush
to see you so attired sworn i think
to show myself a glass
i bless the time
when my good falcon made her flight across
thy fathers ground
now jove afford you cause
to me the difference forges dread your greatness
hath not been used to fear even now i tremble
to think your father by some accident
how would he look to see his work so noble
vilely bound up what would he say or how
should i in these my borrowd flaunts behold
the sternness of his presence
apprehend
nothing but jollity the gods themselves
humbling their deities to love have taken
became a bull and bellowd the green neptune
a ram and bleated and the firerobed god
golden apollo a poor humble swain
as i seem now their transformations
were never for a piece of beauty rarer
nor in a way so chaste since my desires
run not before mine honour nor my lusts
burn hotter than my faith
o but sir
your resolution cannot hold when tis
one of these two must be necessities
which then will speak that you must
change this purpose
or i my life
thou dearest perdita
with these forced thoughts i prithee darken not
the mirth o the feast or ill be thine my fair
or not my fathers for i cannot be
mine own nor any thing to any if
i be not thine to this i am most constant
though destiny say no be merry gentle
strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
lift up your countenance as it were the day
of celebration of that nuptial which
we two have sworn shall come
o lady fortune
stand you auspicious
address yourself to entertain them sprightly
and lets be red with mirth
fie daughter when my old wife lived upon
this day she was both pantler butler cook
both dame and servant welcomed all served all
would sing her song and dance her turn now here
at upper end o the table now i the middle
on his shoulder and his her face o fire
with labour and the thing she took to quench it
she would to each one sip you are retired
as if you were a feasted one and not
these unknown friends tos welcome for it is
a way to make us better friends more known
come quench your blushes and present yourself
and bid us welcome to your sheepshearing
as your good flock shall prosper
shepherdess
a fair one are youwell you fit our ages
with flowers of winter
sir the year growing ancient
not yet on summers death nor on the birth
of trembling winter the fairest
flowers o the season
are our carnations and streakd gillyvors
our rustic gardens barren and i care not
to get slips of them
wherefore gentle maiden
do you neglect them
for i have heard it said
there is an art which in their piedness shares
with great creating nature
say there be
yet nature is made better by no mean
which you say adds to nature is an art
that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry
a gentler scion to the wildest stock
and make conceive a bark of baser kind
which does mend nature change it rather but
the art itself is nature
so it is
then make your garden rich in gillyvors
and do not call them bastards
ill not put
the dibble in earth to set one slip of them
no more than were i painted i would wish
this youth should say twere well and only therefore
desire to breed by me heres flowers for you
hot lavender mints savoury marjoram
the marigold that goes to bed wi the sun
of middle summer and i think they are given
to men of middle age youre very welcome
i should leave grazing were i of your flock
and only live by gazing
out alas
youd be so lean that blasts of january
would blow you through and through
now my fairst friend
i would i had some flowers o the spring that might
become your time of day and yours and yours
that wear upon your virgin branches yet
for the flowers now that frighted thou letst fall
from diss waggon daffodils
that come before the swallow dares and take
the winds of march with beauty violets dim
but sweeter than the lids of junos eyes
or cythereas breath pale primroses
that die unmarried ere they can behold
bight phoebus in his strengtha malady
most incident to maids bold oxlips and
the crown imperial lilies of all kinds
the flowerdeluce being one o these i lack
to make you garlands of and my sweet friend
to strew him oer and oer
what like a corse
no like a bank for love to lie and play on
not like a corse or if not to be buried
methinks i play as i have seen them do
does change my disposition
what you do
still betters what is done when you speak sweet
ild have you buy and sell so so give alms
pray so and for the ordering your affairs
a wave o the sea that you might ever do
nothing but that move still still so
so singular in each particular
crowns what you are doing in the present deed
that all your acts are queens
o doricles
and the true blood which peepeth fairly throught
do plainly give you out an unstaind shepherd
with wisdom i might fear my doricles
you wood me the false way
i think you have
as little skill to fear as i have purpose
that never mean to part
ill swear for em
this is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever
but smacks of something greater than herself
too noble for this place
he tells her something
the queen of curds and cream
come on strike up
to mend her kissing with
now in good time
not a word a word we stand upon our manners
come strike up
pray good shepherd what fair swain is this
which dances with your daughter
they call him doricles and boasts himself
upon his own report and i believe it
i think so too for never gazed the moon
upon the water as hell stand and read
i think there is not half a kiss to choose
who loves another best
she dances featly
so she does any thing though i report it
do light upon her she shall bring him that
which he not dreams of
o master if you did but hear the pedlar at the
door you would never dance again after a tabour and
several tunes faster than youll tell money he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all mens
ears grew to his tunes
he could never come better he shall come in i
love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful
matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably
he hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no
has the prettiest lovesongs for maids so without
bawdry which is strange with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings jump her and thump
her and where some stretchmouthed rascal would
as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into
the matter he makes the maid to answer whoop do me
no harm good man puts him off slights him with
whoop do me no harm good man
this is a brave fellow
believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited
fellow has he any unbraided wares
he hath ribbons of an the colours i the rainbow
points more than all the lawyers in bohemia can
learnedly handle though they come to him by the
sings em over as they were gods or goddesses you
would think a smock were a sheangel he so chants
to the sleevehand and the work about the square ont
prithee bring him in and let him approach singing
forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in s tunes
you have of these pedlars that have more in them
than yould think sister
ay good brother or go about to think
lawn as white as driven snow
cyprus black as eer was crow
gloves as sweet as damask roses
masks for faces and for noses
bugle bracelet necklace amber
perfume for a ladys chamber
golden quoifs and stomachers
pins and pokingsticks of steel
come buy of me come come buy come buy
if i were not in love with mopsa thou shouldst take
no money of me but being enthralled as i am it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves
i was promised them against the feast but they come
not too late now
he hath promised you more than that or there be liars
he hath paid you all he promised you may be he has
paid you more which will shame you to give him again
is there no manners left among maids will they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces is there not milkingtime when you are
going to bed or kilnhole to whistle off these
secrets but you must be tittletattling before all
your tongues and not a word more
i have done come you promised me a tawdrylace
and a pair of sweet gloves
have i not told thee how i was cozened by the way
and lost all my money
and indeed sir there are cozeners abroad
therefore it behoves men to be wary
fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here
i hope so sir for i have about me many parcels of charge
what hast here ballads
life for then we are sure they are true
heres one to a very doleful tune how a usurers
wife was brought to bed of twenty moneybags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders heads and
toads carbonadoed
is it true think you
very true and but a month old
bless me from marrying a usurer
heres the midwifes name tot one mistress
taleporter and five or six honest wives that were
present why should i carry lies abroad
pray you now buy it
ballads well buy the other things anon
heres another ballad of a fish that appeared upon
the coast on wednesday the fourscore of april
forty thousand fathom above water and sung this
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
is it true too think you
five justices hands at it and witnesses more than
my pack will hold
this is a merry ballad but a very pretty one
lets have some merry ones
why this is a passing merry one and goes to
scarce a maid westward but she sings it tis in
request i can tell you

master there is three carters three shepherds
three neatherds three swineherds that have made
themselves all men of hair they call themselves
saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches
say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are
not int but they themselves are o the mind if it
be not too rough for some that know little but
bowling it will please plentifully
homely foolery already i know sir we weary you
these four threes of herdsmen
one three of them by their own report sir hath
danced before the king and not the worst of the
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier
pleased let them come in but quickly now
why they stay at door sir
o father youll know more of that hereafter
is it not too far gone tis time to part them
hes simple and tells much
how now fair shepherd
your heart is full of something that does take
your mind from feasting sooth when i was young
and handed love as you do i was wont
the pedlars silken treasury and have pourd it
to her acceptance you have let him go
and nothing marted with him if your lass
interpretation should abuse and call this
your lack of love or bounty you were straited
for a reply at least if you make a care
of happy holding her
old sir i know
the gifts she looks from me are packd and lockd
up in my heart which i have given already
but not deliverd o hear me breathe my life
before this ancient sir who it should seem
hath sometime loved i take thy hand this hand
as soft as doves down and as white as it
or ethiopians tooth or the fannd
snow thats bolted
by the northern blasts twice oer
what follows this
how prettily the young swain seems to wash
but to your protestation let me hear
what you profess
do and be witness to t
and this my neighbour too
and he and more
that were i crownd the most imperial monarch
thereof most worthy were i the fairest youth
that ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge
more than was ever mans i would not prize them
without her love for her employ them all
commend them and condemn them to her service
or to their own perdition
fairly offerd
this shows a sound affection
but my daughter
say you the like to him
i cannot speak
by the pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out
the purity of his
take hands a bargain
i give my daughter to him and will make
her portion equal his
o that must be
i shall have more than you can dream of yet
enough then for your wonder but come on
contract us fore these witnesses
come your hand
and daughter yours
soft swain awhile beseech you
have you a father
knows he of this
he neither does nor shall
methinks a father
is at the nuptial of his son a guest
that best becomes the table pray you once more
is not your father grown incapable
of reasonable affairs is he not stupid
with age and altering rheums can he speak hear
know man from man dispute his own estate
lies he not bedrid and again does nothing
but what he did being childish
no good sir
he has his health and ampler strength indeed
than most have of his age
by my white beard
you offer him if this be so a wrong
should choose himself a wife but as good reason
the father all whose joy is nothing else
but fair posterity should hold some counsel
in such a business
i yield all this
but for some other reasons my grave sir
which tis not fit you know i not acquaint
my father of this business
let him knowt
he shall not
prithee let him
no he must not
at knowing of thy choice
come come he must not
mark our contract
mark your divorce young sir
whom son i dare not call thou art too base
that thus affectst a sheephook thou old traitor
i am sorry that by hanging thee i can
but shorten thy life one week and thou fresh piece
of excellent witchcraft who of force must know
the royal fool thou copest with
o my heart
ill have thy beauty scratchd with briers and made
more homely than thy state for thee fond boy
if i may ever know thou dost but sigh
that thou no more shalt see this knack as never
i mean thou shalt well bar thee from succession
not hold thee of our blood no not our kin
follow us to the court thou churl for this time
though full of our displeasure yet we free thee
from the dead blow of it and you enchantment
that makes himself but for our honour therein
unworthy theeif ever henceforth thou
these rural latches to his entrance open
or hoop his body more with thy embraces
i will devise a death as cruel for thee
as thou art tender tot
even here undone
i was not much afeard for once or twice
i was about to speak and tell him plainly
the selfsame sun that shines upon his court
hides not his visage from our cottage but
looks on alike willt please you sir be gone
being now awake ill queen it no inch farther
but milk my ewes and weep
why how now father
speak ere thou diest
i cannot speak nor think
nor dare to know that which i know o sir
you have undone a man of fourscore three
that thought to fill his grave in quiet yea
to die upon the bed my father died
some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
where no priest shovels in dust o cursed wretch
that knewst this was the prince
and wouldst adventure
to mingle faith with him undone undone
if i might die within this hour i have lived
to die when i desire
why look you so upon me
i am but sorry not afeard delayd
more straining on for plucking back not following
my leash unwillingly
gracious my lord
he will allow no speech which i do guess
you do not purpose to him and as hardly
then till the fury of his highness settle
come not before him
i not purpose it
i think camillo
even he my lord
how often have i told you twould be thus
how often said my dignity would last
but till twere known
it cannot fail but by
the violation of my faith and then
let nature crush the sides o the earth together
from my succession wipe me father i
am heir to my affection
be advised
will thereto be obedient i have reason
if not my senses better pleased with madness
do bid it welcome
this is desperate sir
i needs must think it honesty camillo
not for bohemia nor the pomp that may
be thereat gleand for all the sun sees or
the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
in unknown fathoms will i break my oath
as you have ever been my fathers honourd friend
when he shall miss meas in faith i mean not
to see him any morecast your good counsels
upon his passion let myself and fortune
tug for the time to come this you may know
and so deliver i am put to sea
with her whom here i cannot hold on shore
and most opportune to our need i have
a vessel rides fast by but not prepared
for this design what course i mean to hold
shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor
concern me the reporting
o my lord
i would your spirit were easier for advice
or stronger for your need
hark perdita
ill hear you by and by
hes irremoveable
resolved for flight now were i happy if
his going i could frame to serve my turn
save him from danger do him love and honour
purchase the sight again of dear sicilia
and that unhappy king my master whom
i so much thirst to see
now good camillo
i am so fraught with curious business that
i leave out ceremony
sir i think
you have heard of my poor services i the love
that i have borne your father
very nobly
to speak your deeds not little of his care
to have them recompensed as thought on
well my lord
if you may please to think i love the king
and through him what is nearest to him which is
if your more ponderous and settled project
may suffer alteration on mine honour
ill point you where you shall have such receiving
as shall become your highness where you may
enjoy your mistress from the whom i see
theres no disjunction to be made but by
as heavens forefendyour ruin marry her
and with my best endeavours in your absence
your discontenting father strive to qualify
and bring him up to liking
how camillo
may this almost a miracle be done
that i may call thee something more than man
and after that trust to thee
have you thought on
a place whereto youll go
but as the unthoughton accident is guilty
to what we wildly do so we profess
ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
of every wind that blows
this follows if you will not change your purpose
but undergo this flight make for sicilia
and there present yourself and your fair princess
she shall be habited as it becomes
the partner of your bed methinks i see
leontes opening his free arms and weeping
his welcomes forth asks thee the son forgiveness
as twere i the fathers person kisses the hands
of your fresh princess oer and oer divides him
twixt his unkindness and his kindness the one
he chides to hell and bids the other grow
faster than thought or time
worthy camillo
what colour for my visitation shall i
hold up before him
sent by the king your father
to greet him and to give him comforts sir
the manner of your bearing towards him with
what you as from your father shall deliver
the which shall point you forth at every sitting
what you must say that he shall not perceive
but that you have your fathers bosom there
and speak his very heart
there is some sap in this
a cause more promising
than a wild dedication of yourselves
to unpathd waters undreamd shores most certain
to miseries enough no hope to help you
but as you shake off one to take another
nothing so certain as your anchors who
do their best office if they can but stay you
prosperitys the very bond of love
whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
affliction alters
i think affliction may subdue the cheek
but not take in the mind
yea say you so
there shall not at your fathers house these
seven years
be born another such
my good camillo
she is as forward of her breeding as
she is i the rear our birth
i cannot say tis pity
she lacks instructions for she seems a mistress
to most that teach
your pardon sir for this
ill blush you thanks
my prettiest perdita
but o the thorns we stand upon camillo
preserver of my father now of me
the medicine of our house how shall we do

ribbon glass pomander brooch tablebook ballad
knife tape glove shoetie bracelet hornring
should buy first as if my trinkets had been
by which means i saw whose purse was best in
picture and what i saw to my good use i
remembered my clown who wants but something to
be a reasonable man grew so in love with the
wenches song that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
was senseless twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse i could have filed keys off that hung in
and admiring the nothing of it so that in this
time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their
festival purses and had not the old man come in
with a whoobub against his daughter and the kings
son and scared my choughs from the chaff i had not
left a purse alive in the whole army
nay but my letters by this means being there
so soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt
and those that youll procure from king leontes
shall satisfy your father
happy be you
all that you speak shows fair
who have we here
well make an instrument of this omit
nothing may give us aid
if they have overheard me now why hanging
how now good fellow why shakest thou so fear
not man heres no harm intended to thee
i am a poor fellow sir
why be so still heres nobody will steal that from
make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly
thou must think theres a necessity intand
pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee
theres some boot
i am a poor fellow sir
i know ye well enough
flayed already
are you in earnest sir
i smell the trick ont
dispatch i prithee
conscience take it
unbuckle unbuckle
fortunate mistresslet my prophecy
come home to yeyou must retire yourself
and pluck it oer your brows muffle your face
dismantle you and as you can disliken
the truth of your own seeming that you may
for i do fear eyes overto shipboard

should i now meet my father
he would not call me son
nay you shall have no hat
come lady come farewell my friend
adieu sir
o perdita what have we twain forgot
pray you a word
fortune speed us
thus we set on camillo to the seaside
the swifter speed the better
open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is
necessary for a cutpurse a good nose is requisite
also to smell out work for the other senses i see
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive
what an exchange had this been without boot what
a boot is here with this exchange sure the gods do
this year connive at us and we may do any thing
extempore the prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity stealing away from his father with his
honesty to acquaint the king withal i would not
and therein am i constant to my profession
every lanes end every shop church session
hanging yields a careful man work
see see what a man you are now
there is no other way but to tell the king
shes a changeling and none of your flesh and blood
nay but hear me
nay but hear me
go to then
she being none of your flesh and blood your flesh
and blood has not offended the king and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him show
those things you found about her those secret
i will tell the king all every word yea and his
sons pranks too who i may say is no honest man
neither to his father nor to me to go about to make
me the kings brotherinlaw
indeed brotherinlaw was the farthest off you
could have been to him and then your blood had been
the dearer by i know how much an ounce
fardel will make him scratch his beard
pray heartily he be at palace
to the palace an it like your worship
your affairs there what with whom the condition
of that fardel the place of your dwelling your
names your ages of what having breeding and any
thing that is fitting to be known discover
we are but plain fellows sir
a lie you are rough and hairy let me have no
it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore
they do not give us the lie
your worship had like to have given us one if you
had not taken yourself with the manner
are you a courtier ant like you sir
whether it like me or no i am a courtier seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court
receives not thy nose courtodor from me reflect i
not on thy baseness courtcontempt thinkest thou
for that i insinuate or toaze from thee thy
business i am therefore no courtier i am courtier
capape and one that will either push on or pluck
open thy affair
my business sir is to the king
what advocate hast thou to him
i know not ant like you
have none
none sir i have no pheasant cock nor hen
how blessed are we that are not simple men
yet nature might have made me as these are
therefore i will not disdain
this cannot be but a great courtier
his garments are rich but he wears
them not handsomely
a great man ill warrant i know by the picking
ons teeth
the fardel there whats i the fardel
wherefore that box
sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box
which none must know but the king and which he
shall know within this hour if i may come to the
speech of him
age thou hast lost thy labour
why sir
the king is not at the palace he is gone aboard a
if thou beest capable of things serious thou must
know the king is full of grief
so tis said sir about his son that should have
married a shepherds daughter
the curses he shall have the tortures he shall
feel will break the back of man the heart of monster
think you so sir
not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to
him though removed fifty times shall all come
yet it is necessary an old sheepwhistling rogue a
ramtender to offer to have his daughter come into
grace some say he shall be stoned but that death
is too soft for him say i draw our throne into a
sheepcote all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy
has the old man eer a son sir do you hear ant
like you sir
he has a son who shall be flayed alive then
nointed over with honey set on the head of a
wasps nest then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead then recovered again with
aquavitae or some other hot infusion then raw as
he is and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims shall be be set against a brickwall the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he
is to behold him with flies blown to death but what
talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries
are to be smiled at their offences being so
capital tell me for you seem to be honest plain
gently considered ill bring you where he is
aboard tender your persons to his presence
whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man
besides the king to effect your suits here is man
shall do it
give him gold and though authority be a stubborn
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand
and no more ado remember stoned and flayed alive
ant please you sir to undertake the business for
more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you
after i have done what i promised
ay sir
well give me the moiety are you a party in this business
one i hope i shall not be flayed out of it
hell be made an example
comfort good comfort we must to the king and show
daughter nor my sister we are gone else sir i
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed and remain as he says your
pawn till it be brought you
i will trust you walk before toward the seaside
hedge and follow you
we are blest in this man as i may say even blest
if i had a mind to be honest i see fortune would
courted now with a double occasion gold and a means
to do the prince my master good which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement i will bring
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing let him call me rogue for being so far
officious for i am proof against that title and
what shame else belongs tot to him will i present
sir you have done enough and have performd
which you have not redeemd indeed paid down
do as the heavens have done forget your evil
with them forgive yourself
whilst i remember
her and her virtues i cannot forget
my blemishes in them and so still think of
the wrong i did myself which was so much
that heirless it hath made my kingdom and
destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man
bred his hopes out of
if one by one you wedded all the world
or from the all that are took something good
to make a perfect woman she you killd
would be unparalleld
i think so killd
sorely to say i did it is as bitter
say so but seldom
you might have spoken a thousand things that would
have done the time more benefit and graced
your kindness better
you are one of those
would have him wed again
if you would not so
you pity not the state nor the remembrance
of his most sovereign name consider little
what dangers by his highness fail of issue
may drop upon his kingdom and devour
incertain lookers on what were more holy
than to rejoice the former queen is well
what holier than for royaltys repair
for present comfort and for future good
to bless the bed of majesty again
with a sweet fellow tot
there is none worthy
respecting her thats gone besides the gods
will have fulfilld their secret purposes
for has not the divine apollo said
ist not the tenor of his oracle
that king leontes shall not have an heir
till his lost child be found which that it shall
is all as monstrous to our human reason
as my antigonus to break his grave
and come again to me who on my life
did perish with the infant tis your counsel
my lord should to the heavens be contrary
oppose against their wills
care not for issue
left his to the worthiest so his successor
was like to be the best
good paulina
who hast the memory of hermione
i know in honour o that ever i
had squared me to thy counsel then even now
i might have lookd upon my queens full eyes
have taken treasure from her lips
and left them
more rich for what they yielded
thou speakst truth
and better used would make her sainted spirit
again possess her corpse and on this stage
where were offenders now appear soulvexd
and begin why to me
had she such power
she had just cause
she had and would incense me
to murder her i married
i should so
were i the ghost that walkd ild bid you mark
her eye and tell me for what dull part int
you chose her then ild shriek that even your ears
should rift to hear me and the words that followd
should be remember mine
stars stars
and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife
ill have no wife paulina
will you swear
never to marry but by my free leave
never paulina so be blest my spirit
then good my lords bear witness to his oath
you tempt him overmuch
unless another
as like hermione as is her picture
affront his eye
good madam
i have done
yet if my lord will marryif you will sir
no remedy but you willgive me the office
as was your former but she shall be such
as walkd your first queens ghost
it should take joy
to see her in your arms
my true paulina
we shall not marry till thou bidst us
that
shall be when your first queens again in breath
never till then
one that gives out himself prince florizel
son of polixenes with his princess she
the fairest i have yet beheld desires access
to your high presence
what with him he comes not
so out of circumstance and sudden tells us
tis not a visitation framed but forced
by need and accident what train
but few
and those but mean
his princess say you with him
ay the most peerless piece of earth i think
that eer the sun shone bright on
o hermione
as every present time doth boast itself
above a better gone so must thy grave
give way to whats seen now sir you yourself
have said and writ so but your writing now
is colder than that theme she had not been
nor was not to be equalldthus your verse
to say you have seen a better
the one i have almost forgotyour pardon
the other when she has obtaind your eye
will have your tongue too this is a creature
would she begin a sect might quench the zeal
of all professors else make proselytes
of who she but bid follow
how not women
women will love her that she is a woman
more worth than any man men that she is
the rarest of all women
go cleomenes
yourself assisted with your honourd friends
bring them to our embracement still tis strange
he thus should steal upon us
had our prince
jewel of children seen this hour he had paird
between their births
prithee no more cease thou knowst
when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches
will bring me to consider that which may
unfurnish me of reason they are come
your mother was most true to wedlock prince
for she did print your royal father off
your fathers image is so hit in you
his very air that i should call you brother
as i did him and speak of something wildly
by us performd before most dearly welcome
and your fair princessgoddesso alas
i lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth
might thus have stood begetting wonder as
all mine own follythe society
amity too of your brave father whom
though bearing misery i desire my life
once more to look on him
by his command
have i here touchd sicilia and from him
give you all greetings that a king at friend
which waits upon worn times hath something seized
his wishd ability he had himself
the lands and waters twixt your throne and his
measured to look upon you whom he loves
he bade me say somore than all the sceptres
and those that bear them living
o my brother
good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir
afresh within me and these thy offices
so rarely kind are as interpreters
of my behindhand slackness welcome hither
as is the spring to the earth and hath he too
exposed this paragon to the fearful usage
at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune
to greet a man not worth her pains much less
the adventure of her person
good my lord
she came from libya
where the warlike smalus
that noble honourd lord is feard and loved
most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter
a prosperous southwind friendly we have crossd
to execute the charge my father gave me
i have from your sicilian shores dismissd
who for bohemia bend to signify
not only my success in libya sir
but my arrival and my wifes in safety
here where we are
the blessed gods
purge all infection from our air whilst you
do climate here you have a holy father
a graceful gentleman against whose person
for which the heavens taking angry note
have left me issueless and your fathers blest
as he from heaven merits it with you
worthy his goodness what might i have been
might i a son and daughter now have lookd on
such goodly things as you
most noble sir
that which i shall report will bear no credit
were not the proof so nigh please you great sir
bohemia greets you from himself by me
desires you to attach his son who has
his dignity and duty both cast off
fled from his father from his hopes and with
a shepherds daughter
wheres bohemia speak
i speak amazedly and it becomes
my marvel and my message to your court
whiles he was hastening in the chase it seems
of this fair couple meets he on the way
the father of this seeming lady and
her brother having both their country quitted
with this young prince
camillo has betrayd me
whose honour and whose honesty till now
endured all weathers
hes with the king your father
who camillo
camillo sir i spake with him who now
has these poor men in question never saw i
bohemia stops his ears and threatens them
with divers deaths in death
o my poor father
the heaven sets spies upon us will not have
our contract celebrated
you are married
we are not sir nor are we like to be
the odds for high and lows alike
my lord
is this the daughter of a king
she is
when once she is my wife
that once i see by your good fathers speed
will come on very slowly i am sorry
most sorry you have broken from his liking
where you were tied in duty and as sorry
your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty
that you might well enjoy her
though fortune visible an enemy
should chase us with my father power no jot
hath she to change our loves beseech you sir
remember since you owed no more to time
step forth mine advocate at your request
my father will grant precious things as trifles
would he do so ild beg your precious mistress
which he counts but a trifle
sir my liege
fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes
than what you look on now
i thought of her
even in these looks i made
but your petition
your honour not oerthrown by your desires
i now go toward him therefore follow me
beseech you sir were you present at this relation
i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old
whereupon after a little amazedness we were all
commanded out of the chamber only this methought i
heard the shepherd say he found the child
i would most gladly know the issue of it
i make a broken delivery of the business but the
changes i perceived in the king and camillo were
staring on one another to tear the cases of their
eyes there was speech in their dumbness language
in their very gesture they looked as they had heard
passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest
beholder that knew no more but seeing could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the
extremity of the one it must needs be
here comes a gentleman that haply knows more
the news rogero
broken out within this hour that balladmakers
cannot be able to express it
deliver you more how goes it now sir this news
which is called true is so like an old tale that
found his heir
most true if ever truth were pregnant by
see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle
of queen hermiones her jewel about the neck of it
the letters of antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the kings daughter did you see
the meeting of the two kings
no
then have you lost a sight which was to be seen
cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one
joy crown another so and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their
joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes
holding up of hands with countenances of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment
not by favour our king being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found daughter as if that
joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother
thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then
embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his
daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old
shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten
conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such
another encounter which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it
what pray you became of antigonus that carried
hence the child
like an old tale still which will have matter to
rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear
avouches the shepherds son who has not only his
innocence which seems much to justify him but a
handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows
what became of his bark and his followers
wrecked the same instant of their masters death and
instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found but o the noble
combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband another elevated that the oracle was
and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
of losing
the dignity of this act was worth the audience of
kings and princes for by such was it acted
one of the prettiest touches of all and that which
angled for mine eyes caught the water though not
the fish was when at the relation of the queens
death with the manner how she came tot bravely
confessed and lamented by the king how
attentiveness wounded his daughter till from one
sign of dolour to another she did with an alas
i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my
heart wept blood who was most marble there changed
could have seen t the woe had been universal
are they returned to the court
which is in the keeping of paulinaa piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
italian master julio romano who had he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work would
beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
are they gone and there they intend to sup
i thought she had some great matter there in hand
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever
since the death of hermione visited that removed
house shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing
who would be thence that has the benefit of access
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge
lets along
now had i not the dash of my former life in me
would preferment drop on my head i brought the old
at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter
so he then took her to be who began to be much
seasick and himself little better extremity of
weather continuing this mystery remained
undiscovered but tis all one to me for had i
been the finder out of this secret it would not
have relished among my other discredits
here come those i have done good to against my will
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune
come boy i am past moe children but thy sons and
daughters will be all gentlemen born
you are well met sir you denied to fight with me
this other day because i was no gentleman born
see you these clothes say you see them not and
lie do and try whether i am not now a gentleman born
i know you are now sir a gentleman born
ay and have been so any time these four hours
and so have i boy
father for the kings son took me by the hand and
called me brother and then the two kings called my
father brother and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father and
so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike
tears that ever we shed
we may live son to shed many more
ay or else twere hard luck being in so
preposterous estate as we are
i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the
faults i have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master
prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are
gentlemen
thou wilt amend thy life
ay an it like your good worship
art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia
you may say it but not swear it
not swear it now i am a gentleman let boors and
franklins say it ill swear it
how if it be false son
if it be neer so false a true gentleman may swear
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
be a tall fellow of thy hands
i will prove so sir to my power
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not
being a tall fellow trust me not hark the kings
and the princes our kindred are going to see the
good masters
o grave and good paulina the great comfort
that i have had of thee
what sovereign sir
i did not well i meant well all my services
with your crownd brother and these your contracted
heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit
it is a surplus of your grace which never
my life may last to answer
o paulina
have we passd through not without much content
in many singularities but we saw not
that which my daughter came to look upon
the statue of her mother
as she lived peerless
so her dead likeness i do well believe
excels whatever yet you lookd upon
or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it
to see the life as lively mockd as ever
i like your silence it the more shows off
comes it not something near
her natural posture
chide me dear stone that i may say indeed
thou art hermione or rather thou art she
in thy not chiding for she was as tender
as infancy and grace but yet paulina
hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing
so aged as this seems
o not by much
so much the more our carvers excellence
which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
as she lived now
as now she might have done
so much to my good comfort as it is
now piercing to my soul o thus she stood
even with such life of majesty warm life
as now it coldly stands when first i wood her
for being more stone than it o royal piece
theres magic in thy majesty which has
my evils conjured to remembrance and
from thy admiring daughter took the spirits
standing like stone with thee
and give me leave
and do not say tis superstition that
i kneel and then implore her blessing lady
dear queen that ended when i but began
give me that hand of yours to kiss
o patience
the statue is but newly fixd the colours not dry
my lord your sorrow was too sore laid on
which sixteen winters cannot blow away
so many summers dry scarce any joy
did ever so long live no sorrow
but killd itself much sooner
dear my brother
let him that was the cause of this have power
to take off so much grief from you as he
will piece up in himself
indeed my lord
if i had thought the sight of my poor image
would thus have wrought youfor the stone is mine
ild not have showd it
do not draw the curtain
no longer shall you gaze ont lest your fancy
may think anon it moves
let be let be
would i were dead but that methinks already
what was he that did make it see my lord
would you not deem it breathed and that those veins
did verily bear blood
the very life seems warm upon her lip
the fixture of her eye has motion int
as we are mockd with art
my lords almost so far transported that
hell think anon it lives
o sweet paulina
make me to think so twenty years together
no settled senses of the world can match
the pleasure of that madness let t alone
i could afflict you farther
do paulina
for this affliction has a taste as sweet
as any cordial comfort still methinks
could ever yet cut breath let no man mock me
for i will kiss her
the ruddiness upon her lip is wet
youll mar it if you kiss it stain your own
with oily painting shall i draw the curtain
no not these twenty years
so long could i
stand by a looker on
either forbear
quit presently the chapel or resolve you
for more amazement if you can behold it
ill make the statue move indeed descend
and take you by the hand but then youll think
which i protest againsti am assisted
by wicked powers
what you can make her do
i am content to hear for tis as easy
to make her speak as move
it is required
you do awake your faith then all stand still
i am about let them depart
no foot shall stir
music awake her strike
tis time descend be stone no more approach
strike all that look upon with marvel come
bequeath to death your numbness for from him
start not her actions shall be holy as
until you see her die again for then
when she was young you wood her now in age
is she become the suitor
o shes warm
if this be magic let it be an art
lawful as eating
she embraces him
if she pertain to life let her speak too
ay and maket manifest where she has lived
or how stolen from the dead
that she is living
were it but told you should be hooted at
though yet she speak not mark a little while
and pray your mothers blessing turn good lady
our perdita is found
you gods look down
and from your sacred vials pour your graces
upon my daughters head tell me mine own
where hast thou been preserved where lived how found
thy fathers court for thou shalt hear that i
knowing by paulina that the oracle
gave hope thou wast in being have preserved
myself to see the issue
theres time enough for that
lest they desire upon this push to trouble
your joys with like relation go together
you precious winners all your exultation
partake to every one i an old turtle
will wing me to some witherd bough and there
my mate thats never to be found again
lament till i am lost
o peace paulina
thou shouldst a husband take by my consent
and made betweens by vows thou hast found mine
but how is to be questiond for i saw her
as i thought dead and have in vain said many
a prayer upon her grave ill not seek far
for him i partly know his mindto find thee
an honourable husband come camillo
and take her by the hand whose worth and honesty
is richly noted and here justified
by us a pair of kings lets from this place
that eer i put between your holy looks
my ill suspicion this is your soninlaw
and son unto the king who heavens directing
is trothplight to your daughter good paulina
lead us from hence where we may leisurely
each one demand an answer to his part
performd in this wide gap of time since first
escalus
my lord
of government the properties to unfold
would seem in me to affect speech and discourse
since i am put to know that your own science
exceeds in that the lists of all advice
but that to your sufficiency as your worth is able
and let them work the nature of our people
our citys institutions and the terms
for common justice youre as pregnant in
as art and practise hath enriched any
that we remember there is our commission
from which we would not have you warp call hither
i say bid come before us angelo
what figure of us think you he will bear
for you must know we have with special soul
elected him our absence to supply
lent him our terror dressd him with our love
and given his deputation all the organs
if any in vienna be of worth
to undergo such ample grace and honour
it is lord angelo
look where he comes
always obedient to your graces will
i come to know your pleasure
angelo
there is a kind of character in thy life
that to the observer doth thy history
fully unfold thyself and thy belongings
are not thine own so proper as to waste
thyself upon thy virtues they on thee
heaven doth with us as we with torches do
not light them for themselves for if our virtues
did not go forth of us twere all alike
as if we had them not spirits are not finely touchd
but to fine issues nor nature never lends
the smallest scruple of her excellence
but like a thrifty goddess she determines
herself the glory of a creditor
both thanks and use but i do bend my speech
to one that can my part in him advertise
in our remove be thou at full ourself
mortality and mercy in vienna
though first in question is thy secondary
take thy commission
now good my lord
let there be some more test made of my metal
before so noble and so great a figure
be stampd upon it
we have with a leavend and prepared choice
proceeded to you therefore take your honours
our haste from hence is of so quick condition
that it prefers itself and leaves unquestiond
matters of needful value we shall write to you
as time and our concernings shall importune
how it goes with us and do look to know
what doth befall you here so fare you well
to the hopeful execution do i leave you
of your commissions
yet give leave my lord
that we may bring you something on the way
my haste may not admit it
nor need you on mine honour have to do
with any scruple your scope is as mine own
so to enforce or qualify the laws
ill privily away i love the people
through it do well i do not relish well
their loud applause and aves vehement
nor do i think the man of safe discretion
that does affect it once more fare you well
the heavens give safety to your purposes
lead forth and bring you back in happiness
i thank you fare you well
i shall desire you sir to give me leave
to have free speech with you and it concerns me
a power i have but of what strength and nature
i am not yet instructed
tis so with me let us withdraw together
and we may soon our satisfaction have
touching that point
ill wait upon your honour
if the duke with the other dukes come not to
composition with the king of hungary why then all
the dukes fall upon the king
heaven grant us its peace but not the king of
hungarys
amen
thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate that
went to sea with the ten commandments but scraped
one out of the table
thou shalt not steal
ay that he razed
why twas a commandment to command the captain and
to steal theres not a soldier of us all that in
the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition
well that prays for peace
i never heard any soldier dislike it
i believe thee for i think thou never wast where
grace was said
no a dozen times at least
what in metre
in any proportion or in any language
i think or in any religion
ay why not grace is grace despite of all
wicked villain despite of all grace
well there went but a pair of shears between us
i grant as there may between the lists and the
velvet thou art the list
be a list of an english kersey as be piled as thou
art piled for a french velvet do i speak
feelingly now
i think thou dost and indeed with most painful
confession learn to begin thy health but whilst i
live forget to drink after thee
i think i have done myself wrong have i not
yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free
behold behold where madam mitigation comes i
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to
to what i pray
judge
to three thousand dolours a year
ay and more
a french crown more
thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou
art full of error i am sound
nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as
impiety has made a feast of thee
how now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica
well well theres one yonder arrested and carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all
whos that i pray thee
marry sir thats claudio signior claudio
claudio to prison tis not so
him carried away and which is more within these
three days his head to be chopped off
but after all this fooling i would not have it so
art thou sure of this
julietta with child
hours since and he was ever precise in
promisekeeping
besides you know it draws something near to the
speech we had to such a purpose
but most of all agreeing with the proclamation
away lets go learn the truth of it
thus what with the war what with the sweat what
with the gallows and what with poverty i am
customshrunk
how now whats the news with you
yonder man is carried to prison
well what has he done
a woman
but whats his offence
groping for trouts in a peculiar river
what is there a maid with child by him
no but theres a woman with maid by him you have
not heard of the proclamation have you
what proclamation man
all houses in the suburbs of vienna must be plucked down
and what shall become of those in the city
but that a wise burgher put in for them
but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
pulled down
to the ground mistress
why heres a change indeed in the commonwealth
what shall become of me
change your trade ill be your tapster still
have worn your eyes almost out in the service you
will be considered
whats to do here thomas tapster lets withdraw
here comes signior claudio led by the provost to
prison and theres madam juliet
fellow why dost thou show me thus to the world
bear me to prison where i am committed
i do it not in evil disposition
but from lord angelo by special charge
thus can the demigod authority
make us pay down for our offence by weight
the words of heaven on whom it will it will
on whom it will not so yet still tis just
why how now claudio whence comes this restraint
as surfeit is the father of much fast
so every scope by the immoderate use
turns to restraint our natures do pursue
like rats that ravin down their proper bane
a thirsty evil and when we drink we die
if could speak so wisely under an arrest i would
the truth i had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment whats thy
offence claudio
what but to speak of would offend again
what ist murder
no
lechery
call it so
away sir you must go
one word good friend lucio a word with you
a hundred if theyll do you any good
is lechery so lookd after
you know the lady she is fast my wife
save that we do the denunciation lack
only for propagation of a dower
remaining in the coffer of her friends
from whom we thought it meet to hide our love
till time had made them for us but it chances
the stealth of our most mutual entertainment
with character too gross is writ on juliet
with child perhaps
unhappily even so
and the new deputy now for the duke
whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness
or whether that the body public be
a horse whereon the governor doth ride
who newly in the seat that it may know
he can command lets it straight feel the spur
whether the tyranny be in his place
or in his emmence that fills it up
awakes me all the enrolled penalties
which have like unscourd armour hung by the wall
so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
and none of them been worn and for a name
now puts the drowsy and neglected act
thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love
may sigh it off send after the duke and appeal to
him
i have done so but hes not to be found
this day my sister should the cloister enter
implore her in my voice that she make friends
i have great hope in that for in her youth
there is a prone and speechless dialect
such as move men beside she hath prosperous art
when she will play with reason and discourse
and well she can persuade
i pray she may as well for the encouragement of the
like which else would stand under grievous
imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who i
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of ticktack ill to her
i thank you good friend lucio
within two hours
come officer away
no holy father throw away that thought
believe not that the dribbling dart of love
can pierce a complete bosom why i desire thee
to give me secret harbour hath a purpose
more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
of burning youth
may your grace speak of it
my holy sir none better knows than you
how i have ever loved the life removed
and held in idle price to haunt assemblies
where youth and cost and witless bravery keeps
i have deliverd to lord angelo
a man of stricture and firm abstinence
my absolute power and place here in vienna
and he supposes me travelld to poland
for so i have strewd it in the common ear
and so it is received now pious sir
you will demand of me why i do this
gladly my lord
we have strict statutes and most biting laws
the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds
which for this nineteen years we have let slip
even like an oergrown lion in a cave
that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers
having bound up the threatening twigs of birch
only to stick it in their childrens sight
for terror not to use in time the rod
becomes more mockd than feard so our decrees
dead to infliction to themselves are dead
and liberty plucks justice by the nose
the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart
goes all decorum
it rested in your grace
and it in you more dreadful would have seemd
than in lord angelo
sith twas my fault to give the people scope
twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
when evil deeds have their permissive pass
and not the punishment therefore indeed my father
i have on angelo imposed the office
who may in the ambush of my name strike home
and yet my nature never in the fight
to do in slander and to behold his sway
i will as twere a brother of your order
supply me with the habit and instruct me
how i may formally in person bear me
like a true friar more reasons for this action
at our more leisure shall i render you
stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses
that his blood flows or that his appetite
if power change purpose what our seemers be
and have you nuns no farther privileges
are not these large enough
yes truly i speak not as desiring more
but rather wishing a more strict restraint
upon the sisterhood the votarists of saint clare
whos that which calls
it is a mans voice gentle isabella
turn you the key and know his business of him
you may i may not you are yet unsworn
when you have vowd you must not speak with men
then if you speak you must not show your face
or if you show your face you must not speak
he calls again i pray you answer him
peace and prosperity who ist that calls
hail virgin if you be as those cheekroses
proclaim you are no less can you so stead me
as bring me to the sight of isabella
a novice of this place and the fair sister
to her unhappy brother claudio
why her unhappy brother let me ask
the rather for i now must make you know
i am that isabella and his sister
not to be weary with you hes in prison
woe me for what
for that which if myself might be his judge
he hath got his friend with child
sir make me not your story
it is true
i would notthough tis my familiar sin
with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest
i hold you as a thing enskyd and sainted
by your renouncement an immortal spirit
and to be talkd with in sincerity
as with a saint
you do blaspheme the good in mocking me
as those that feed grow full as blossoming time
that from the seedness the bare fallow brings
to teeming foison even so her plenteous womb
expresseth his full tilth and husbandry
some one with child by him my cousin juliet
is she your cousin
adoptedly as schoolmaids change their names
by vain though apt affection
she it is
o let him marry her
this is the point
the duke is very strangely gone from hence
bore many gentlemen myself being one
by those that know the very nerves of state
his givingsout were of an infinite distance
from his truemeant design upon his place
and with full line of his authority
governs lord angelo a man whose blood
is very snowbroth one who never feels
the wanton stings and motions of the sense
but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
with profits of the mind study and fast
heto give fear to use and liberty
which have for long run by the hideous law
as mice by lionshath pickd out an act
under whose heavy sense your brothers life
and follows close the rigour of the statute
to make him an example all hope is gone
unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
twixt you and your poor brother
doth he so seek his life
has censured him
already and as i hear the provost hath
a warrant for his execution
alas what poor abilitys in me
to do him good
assay the power you have
my power alas i doubt
our doubts are traitors
and make us lose the good we oft might win
by fearing to attempt go to lord angelo
and let him learn to know when maidens sue
men give like gods but when they weep and kneel
all their petitions are as freely theirs
as they themselves would owe them
ill see what i can do
but speedily
i will about it straight
no longer staying but to give the mother
ill send him certain word of my success
i take my leave of you
good sir adieu
we must not make a scarecrow of the law
setting it up to fear the birds of prey
and let it keep one shape till custom make it
their perch and not their terror
ay but yet
let us be keen and rather cut a little
than fall and bruise to death alas this gentleman
whom i would save had a most noble father
let but your honour know
whom i believe to be most strait in virtue
that in the working of your own affections
had time cohered with place or place with wishing
or that the resolute acting of your blood
could have attaind the effect of your own purpose
whether you had not sometime in your life
errd in this point which now you censure him
and pulld the law upon you
tis one thing to be tempted escalus
another thing to fall i not deny
the jury passing on the prisoners life
may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
guiltier than him they try whats open made to justice
that thieves do pass on thieves tis very pregnant
the jewel that we find we stoop and taket
because we see it but what we do not see
we tread upon and never think of it
you may not so extenuate his offence
for i have had such faults but rather tell me
when i that censure him do so offend
let mine own judgment pattern out my death
and nothing come in partial sir he must die
be it as your wisdom will
where is the provost
here if it like your honour
see that claudio
bring him his confessor let him be prepared
for thats the utmost of his pilgrimage
a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
how now sir whats your name and whats the matter
if it please your honour i am the poor dukes
justice sir and do bring in here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors

there shall be order fort
god save your honour
stay a little while
i am a woeful suitor to your honour
please but your honour hear me
well whats your suit
there is a vice that most i do abhor
and most desire should meet the blow of justice
for which i would not plead but that i must
for which i must not plead but that i am
at war twixt will and will not
well the matter
i do beseech you let it be his fault
and not my brother
condemn the fault and not the actor of it
mine were the very cipher of a function
to fine the faults whose fine stands in record
and let go by the actor
o just but severe law
i had a brother then heaven keep your honour
must he needs die
maiden no remedy
yes i do think that you might pardon him
and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy
i will not dot
but can you if you would
look what i will not that i cannot do
but might you dot and do the world no wrong
if so your heart were touchd with that remorse
as mine is to him
hes sentenced tis too late
too late why no i that do speak a word
may call it back again well believe this
no ceremony that to great ones longs
not the kings crown nor the deputed sword
the marshals truncheon nor the judges robe
become them with one half so good a grace
as mercy does
if he had been as you and you as he
you would have slipt like him but he like you
would not have been so stern
pray you be gone
i would to heaven i had your potency
and you were isabel should it then be thus
no i would tell what twere to be a judge
and what a prisoner
your brother is a forfeit of the law
and you but waste your words
alas alas
why all the souls that were were forfeit once
and he that might the vantage best have took
found out the remedy how would you be
if he which is the top of judgment should
but judge you as you are o think on that
and mercy then will breathe within your lips
like man new made
be you content fair maid
were he my kinsman brother or my son
tomorrow o thats sudden spare him spare him
hes not prepared for death even for our kitchens
with less respect than we do minister
to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you
who is it that hath died for this offence
theres many have committed it
those many had not dared to do that evil
if the first that did the edict infringe
takes note of what is done and like a prophet
looks in a glass that shows what future evils
either new or by remissness newconceived
and so in progress to be hatchd and born
are now to have no successive degrees
but ere they live to end
yet show some pity
i show it most of all when i show justice
for then i pity those i do not know
which a dismissd offence would after gall
and do him right that answering one foul wrong
lives not to act another be satisfied
your brother dies tomorrow be content
so you must be the first that gives this sentence
and he that suffers o it is excellent
to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous
to use it like a giant
could great men thunder
as jove himself does jove would neer be quiet
for every pelting petty officer
would use his heaven for thunder
nothing but thunder merciful heaven
thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
splitst the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
drest in a little brief authority
most ignorant of what hes most assured
his glassy essence like an angry ape
plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
as make the angels weep who with our spleens
would all themselves laugh mortal
great men may jest with saints tis wit in them
but in the less foul profanation
thourt i the right girl more o that
that in the captains but a choleric word
which in the soldier is flat blasphemy
why do you put these sayings upon me
because authority though it err like others
hath yet a kind of medicine in itself
that skins the vice o the top go to your bosom
knock there and ask your heart what it doth know
a natural guiltiness such as is his
let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
against my brothers life
gentle my lord turn back
how bribe me
ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you
not with fond shekels of the tested gold
or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
as fancy values them but with true prayers
that shall be up at heaven and enter there
ere sunrise prayers from preserved souls
from fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
to nothing temporal
well come to me tomorrow
heaven keep your honour safe
at what hour tomorrow
shall i attend your lordship
at any time fore noon
save your honour
from thee even from thy virtue
whats this whats this is this her fault or mine
the tempter or the tempted who sins most
ha
that lying by the violet in the sun
do as the carrion does not as the flower
corrupt with virtuous season can it be
that modesty may more betray our sense
than womans lightness having waste ground enough
shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie
what dost thou or what art thou angelo
dost thou desire her foully for those things
that make her good o let her brother live
thieves for their robbery have authority
when judges steal themselves what do i love her
that i desire to hear her speak again
and feast upon her eyes what ist i dream on
o cunning enemy that to catch a saint
with saints dost bait thy hook most dangerous
is that temptation that doth goad us on
with all her double vigour art and nature
once stir my temper but this virtuous maid
subdues me quite even till now
when men were fond i smiled and wonderd how
hail to you provost so i think you are
i am the provost whats your will good friar
bound by my charity and my blest order
i come to visit the afflicted spirits
here in the prison do me the common right
to let me see them and to make me know
the nature of their crimes that i may minister
to them accordingly
i would do more than that if more were needful
who falling in the flaws of her own youth
and he that got it sentenced a young man
more fit to do another such offence
than die for this
when must he die
as i do think tomorrow
and you shall be conducted
repent you fair one of the sin you carry
i do and bear the shame most patiently
ill teach you how you shall arraign your conscience
and try your penitence if it be sound
or hollowly put on
ill gladly learn
love you the man that wrongd you
yes as i love the woman that wrongd him
so then it seems your most offenceful act
was mutually committed
mutually
then was your sin of heavier kind than his
i do confess it and repent it father
as that the sin hath brought you to this shame
which sorrow is always towards ourselves not heaven
showing we would not spare heaven as we love it
but as we stand in fear
i do repent me as it is an evil
and take the shame with joy
there rest
your partner as i hear must die tomorrow
and i am going with instruction to him
grace go with you benedicite
must die tomorrow o injurious love
that respites me a life whose very comfort
is still a dying horror
tis pity of him
when i would pray and think i think and pray
to several subjects heaven hath my empty words
whilst my invention hearing not my tongue
as if i did but only chew his name
and in my heart the strong and swelling evil
of my conception the state whereon i studied
is like a good thing being often read
grown feard and tedious yea my gravity
whereinlet no man hear mei take pride
could i with boot change for an idle plume
which the air beats for vain o place o form
how often dost thou with thy case thy habit
wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
tis not the devils crest
how now whos there
one isabel a sister desires access to you
teach her the way
o heavens
why does my blood thus muster to my heart
making both it unable for itself
and dispossessing all my other parts
of necessary fitness
so play the foolish throngs with one that swoons
come all to help him and so stop the air
the general subject to a wellwishd king
quit their own part and in obsequious fondness
crowd to his presence where their untaught love
must needs appear offence
how now fair maid
i am come to know your pleasure
that you might know it would much better please me
than to demand what tis your brother cannot live
even so heaven keep your honour
yet may he live awhile and it may be
as long as you or i yet he must die
under your sentence
yea
when i beseech you that in his reprieve
longer or shorter he may be so fitted
that his soul sicken not
ha fie these filthy vices it were as good
to pardon him that hath from nature stolen
a man already made as to remit
their saucy sweetness that do coin heavens image
falsely to take away a life true made
as to put metal in restrained means
to make a false one
tis set down so in heaven but not in earth
say you so then i shall pose you quickly
which had you rather that the most just law
now took your brothers life or to redeem him
give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
as she that he hath staind
sir believe this
i had rather give my body than my soul
stand more for number than for accompt
how say you
nay ill not warrant that for i can speak
i now the voice of the recorded law
might there not be a charity in sin
to save this brothers life
please you to dot
ill take it as a peril to my soul
it is no sin at all but charity
pleased you to dot at peril of your soul
were equal poise of sin and charity
that i do beg his life if it be sin
heaven let me bear it you granting of my suit
if that be sin ill make it my morn prayer
to have it added to the faults of mine
and nothing of your answer
nay but hear me
or seem so craftily and thats not good
let me be ignorant and in nothing good
but graciously to know i am no better
thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
when it doth tax itself as these black masks
proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
than beauty could displayd but mark me
your brother is to die
so
and his offence is so as it appears
accountant to the law upon that pain
true
admit no other way to save his life
as i subscribe not that nor any other
but in the loss of questionthat you his sister
finding yourself desired of such a person
whose credit with the judge or own great place
could fetch your brother from the manacles
of the allbuilding law and that there were
no earthly mean to save him but that either
you must lay down the treasures of your body
to this supposed or else to let him suffer
what would you do
that is were i under the terms of death
the impression of keen whips ild wear as rubies
and strip myself to death as to a bed
that longing have been sick for ere ild yield
my body up to shame
then must your brother die
better it were a brother died at once
than that a sister by redeeming him
should die for ever
were not you then as cruel as the sentence
that you have slanderd so
ignomy in ransom and free pardon
is nothing kin to foul redemption
you seemd of late to make the law a tyrant
and rather proved the sliding of your brother
a merriment than a vice
o pardon me my lord it oft falls out
i something do excuse the thing i hate
for his advantage that i dearly love
we are all frail
else let my brother die
if not a feodary but only he
owe and succeed thy weakness
nay women are frail too
ay as the glasses where they view themselves
which are as easy broke as they make forms
women help heaven men their creation mar
in profiting by them nay call us ten times frail
for we are soft as our complexions are
and credulous to false prints
and from this testimony of your own sex
since i suppose we are made to be no stronger
than faults may shake our frameslet me be bold
i do arrest your words be that you are
that is a woman if you be more youre none
if you be one as you are well expressd
by all external warrants show it now
by putting on the destined livery
let me entreat you speak the former language
plainly conceive i love you
my brother did love juliet
and you tell me that he shall die for it
he shall not isabel if you give me love
i know your virtue hath a licence int
which seems a little fouler than it is
to pluck on others
believe me on mine honour
my words express my purpose
ha little honour to be much believed
and most pernicious purpose seeming seeming
sign me a present pardon for my brother
or with an outstretchd throat ill tell the world aloud
what man thou art
who will believe thee isabel
my unsoild name the austereness of my life
my vouch against you and my place i the state
will so your accusation overweigh
that you shall stifle in your own report
and smell of calumny i have begun
fit thy consent to my sharp appetite
lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes
that banish what they sue for redeem thy brother
by yielding up thy body to my will
or else he must not only die the death
but thy unkindness shall his death draw out
to lingering sufferance answer me tomorrow
or by the affection that now guides me most
ill prove a tyrant to him as for you
say what you can my false oerweighs your true
to whom should i complain did i tell this
who would believe me o perilous mouths
that bear in them one and the selfsame tongue
either of condemnation or approof
hooking both right and wrong to the appetite
though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood
yet hath he in him such a mind of honour
that had he twenty heads to tender down
on twenty bloody blocks held yield them up
before his sister should her body stoop
to such abhorrd pollution
more than our brother is our chastity
ill tell him yet of angelos request
and fit his mind to death for his souls rest
so then you hope of pardon from lord angelo
the miserable have no other medicine
ive hope to live and am prepared to die
be absolute for death either death or life
if i do lose thee i do lose a thing
servile to all the skyey influences
that dost this habitation where thou keepst
for him thou labourst by thy flight to shun
and yet runnst toward him still thou art not noble
for all the accommodations that thou bearst
are nursed by baseness thourt by no means valiant
for thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep
and that thou oft provokest yet grossly fearst
thy death which is no more thou art not thyself
for thou existst on many a thousand grains
that issue out of dust happy thou art not
for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get
and what thou hast forgetst thou art not certain
for thy complexion shifts to strange effects
after the moon if thou art rich thourt poor
for like an ass whose back with ingots bows
thou bears thy heavy riches but a journey
and death unloads thee friend hast thou none
for thine own bowels which do call thee sire
the mere effusion of thy proper loins
do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum
for ending thee no sooner thou hast nor youth nor age
but as it were an afterdinners sleep
dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth
becomes as aged and doth beg the alms
of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich
thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty
to make thy riches pleasant whats yet in this
that bears the name of life yet in this life
that makes these odds all even
i humbly thank you
to sue to live i find i seek to die
dear sir ere long ill visit you again
most holy sir i thank you
my business is a word or two with claudio
and very welcome look signior heres your sister
provost a word with you
as many as you please
bring me to hear them speak where i may be concealed
now sister whats the comfort
why
as all comforts are most good most good indeed
lord angelo having affairs to heaven
intends you for his swift ambassador
therefore your best appointment make with speed
tomorrow you set on
is there no remedy
none but such remedy as to save a head
to cleave a heart in twain
but is there any
there is a devilish mercy in the judge
if youll implore it that will free your life
but fetter you till death
perpetual durance
ay just perpetual durance a restraint
though all the worlds vastidity you had
to a determined scope
but in what nature
in such a one as you consenting tot
would bark your honour from that trunk you bear
and leave you naked
let me know the point
o i do fear thee claudio and i quake
lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain
and six or seven winters more respect
than a perpetual honour darest thou die
the sense of death is most in apprehension
and the poor beetle that we tread upon
in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
as when a giant dies
why give you me this shame
think you i can a resolution fetch
from flowery tenderness if i must die
i will encounter darkness as a bride
and hug it in mine arms
there spake my brother there my fathers grave
thou art too noble to conserve a life
in base appliances this outwardsainted deputy
whose settled visage and deliberate word
nips youth i the head and follies doth emmew
as falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil
his filth within being cast he would appear
a pond as deep as hell
the prenzie angelo
o tis the cunning livery of hell
the damnedst body to invest and cover
in prenzie guards dost thou think claudio
if i would yield him my virginity
thou mightst be freed
o heavens it cannot be
yes he would givet thee from this rank offence
so to offend him still this nights the time
that i should do what i abhor to name
or else thou diest tomorrow
thou shalt not dot
o were it but my life
ild throw it down for your deliverance
as frankly as a pin
thanks dear isabel
be ready claudio for your death tomorrow
yes has he affections in him
that thus can make him bite the law by the nose
when he would force it sure it is no sin
or of the deadly seven it is the least
which is the least
if it were damnable he being so wise
why would he for the momentary trick
be perdurably fined o isabel
what says my brother
death is a fearful thing
and shamed life a hateful
ay but to die and go we know not where
to lie in cold obstruction and to rot
this sensible warm motion to become
a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit
to bathe in fiery floods or to reside
in thrilling region of thickribbed ice
to be imprisond in the viewless winds
and blown with restless violence round about
the pendent world or to be worse than worst
of those that lawless and incertain thought
the weariest and most loathed worldly life
that age ache penury and imprisonment
can lay on nature is a paradise
to what we fear of death
alas alas
what sin you do to save a brothers life
nature dispenses with the deed so far
that it becomes a virtue
o you beast
o faithless coward o dishonest wretch
wilt thou be made a man out of my vice
ist not a kind of incest to take life
from thine own sisters shame what should i think
heaven shield my mother playd my father fair
for such a warped slip of wilderness
neer issued from his blood take my defiance
die perish might but my bending down
ill pray a thousand prayers for thy death
no word to save thee
nay hear me isabel
o fie fie fie
thy sins not accidental but a trade
tis best thou diest quickly
o hear me isabella
vouchsafe a word young sister but one word
what is your will
might you dispense with your leisure i would by and
would require is likewise your own benefit
i have no superfluous leisure my stay must be
stolen out of other affairs but i will attend you awhile
son i have overheard what hath passed between you
and your sister angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
glad to receive i am confessor to angelo and i
know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to
your knees and make ready
let me ask my sister pardon i am so out of love
with life that i will sue to be rid of it
provost a word with you
whats your will father
that now you are come you will be gone leave me
habit no loss shall touch her by my company
in good time
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness but grace being the soul of
your complexion shall keep the body of it ever
fair the assault that angelo hath made to you
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding and but
that frailty hath examples for his falling i should
wonder at angelo how will you do to content this
substitute and to save your brother
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born but o how much is the good duke
deceived in angelo if ever he return and i can
speak to him i will open my lips in vain or
discover his government
now stands he will avoid your accusation he made
trial of you only therefore fasten your ear on my
remedy presents itself i do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from
the angry law do no stain to your own gracious
person and much please the absent duke if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business
let me hear you speak farther i have spirit to do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit
virtue is bold and goodness never fearful have
you not heard speak of mariana the sister of
frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea
i have heard of the lady and good words went with her name
she should this angelo have married was affianced
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity her brother frederick was wrecked at sea
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister but mark how heavily this befell to the
renowned brother in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of
her fortune her marriagedowry with both her
combinate husband this wellseeming angelo
can this be so did angelo so leave her
left her in her tears and dried not one of them
with his comfort swallowed his vows whole
bestowed her on her own lamentation which she yet
wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears
is washed with them but relents not
what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
from the world what corruption in this life that
it will let this man live but how out of this can she avail
cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it
show me how good father
this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
in all reason should have quenched her love hath
like an impediment in the current made it more
violent and unruly go you to angelo answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience agree with
his demands to the point only refer yourself to
this advantage first that your stay with him may
not be long that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it and the place answer to convenience
this being granted in courseand now follows
allwe shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
your appointment go in your place if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to
saved your honour untainted the poor mariana
advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled the maid
will i frame and make fit for his attempt if you
think well to carry this as you may the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof
what think you of it
the image of it gives me content already and i
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection
it lies much in your holding up haste you speedily
bed give him promise of satisfaction i will
grange resides this dejected mariana at that
place call upon me and dispatch with angelo that
it may be quickly
i thank you for this comfort fare you well good father
nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will
needs buy and sell men and women like beasts we
shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard
o heavens what stuff is here
twas never merry world since of two usuries the
merriest was put down and the worser allowed by
order of law a furred gown to keep him warm and
furred with fox and lambskins too to signify that
craft being richer than innocency stands for the facing

as good go a mile on his errand
that we were all as some would seem to be
from our faults as faults from seeming free
his neck will come to your waista cord sir
i spy comfort i cry bail heres a gentleman and a
friend of mine

what news
come your ways sir come
go to kennel pompey go
what news friar of the duke
i know none can you tell me of any
some say he is with the emperor of russia other
i know not where but wheresoever i wish him well
it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
the state and usurp the beggary he was never born
to lord angelo dukes it well in his absence he
puts transgression to t
he does well in t
a little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
it is too general a vice and severity must cure it
yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred
it quite friar till eating and drinking be put
down they say this angelo was not made by man and
true think you
how should he be made then
some report a seamaid spawned him some that he
was begot between two stockfishes but it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
motion generative thats infallible
you are pleasant sir and speak apace
why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man would the duke that is absent have done this
ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing
knew the service and that instructed him to mercy
i never heard the absent duke much detected for
women he was not inclined that way
o sir you are deceived
tis not possible
who not the duke yes your beggar of fifty and
duke had crotchets in him he would be drunk too
that let me inform you
you do him wrong surely
sir i was an inward of his a shy fellow was the
withdrawing
what i prithee might be the cause
no pardon tis a secret must be locked within the
understand the greater file of the subject held the
duke to be wise
wise why no question but he was
a very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation let him be but testimonied in his own
bringingsforth and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice
sir i know him and i love him
love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with
dearer love
come sir i know what i know
i can hardly believe that since you know not what
you speak but if ever the duke return as our
prayers are he may let me desire you to make your
answer before him if it be honest you have spoke
upon you and i pray you your name
sir my name is lucio well known to the duke
he shall know you better sir if i may live to
report you
i fear you not
o you hope the duke will return no more or you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite but indeed i
can do you little harm youll forswear this again
friar but no more of this canst thou tell if
claudio die tomorrow or no
why should he die sir
why for filling a bottle with a tundish i would
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency sparrows must not build in his
houseeaves because they are lecherous the duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would
marry this claudio is condemned for untrussing
duke i say to thee again would eat mutton on
fridays hes not past it yet and i say to thee
he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown
no might nor greatness in mortality
can censure scape backwounding calumny
the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong
can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue
but who comes here
go away with her to prison
good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted
a merciful man good my lord
double and treble admonition and still forfeit in
the same kind this would make mercy swear and play
the tyrant
a bawd of eleven years continuance may it please
your honour
my lord this is one lucios information against me
mistress kate keepdown was with child by him in the
i have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me
called before us away with her to prison go to
no more words
provost my brother angelo will not be altered
with divines and have all charitable preparation
if my brother wrought by my pity it should not be
so with him
so please you this friar hath been with him and
advised him for the entertainment of death
good even good father
bliss and goodness on you
of whence are you
not of this country though my chance is now
of gracious order late come from the see
in special business from his holiness
what news abroad i the world
none but that there is so great a fever on
novelty is only in request and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking there is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure but
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world this
news is old enough yet it is every days news i
pray you sir of what disposition was the duke
one that above all other strifes contended
especially to know himself
what pleasure was he given to
rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at
gentleman of all temperance but leave we him to
his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous
and let me desire to know how you find claudio
prepared i am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation
he professes to have received no sinister measure
from his judge but most willingly humbles himself
to himself by the instruction of his frailty many
deceiving promises of life which i by my good
leisure have discredited to him and now is he
resolved to die
you have paid the heavens your function and the
prisoner the very debt of your calling i have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
found so severe that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed justice
if his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he
chance to fail he hath sentenced himself
i am going to visit the prisoner fare you well
peace be with you
he who the sword of heaven will bear
should be as holy as severe
pattern in himself to know
grace to stand and virtue go
more nor less to others paying
than by selfoffences weighing
shame to him whose cruel striking
kills for faults of his own liking
twice treble shame on angelo
to weed my vice and let his grow
o what may man within him hide
though angel on the outward side
how may likeness made in crimes
making practise on the times
to draw with idle spiders strings
most ponderous and substantial things
with angelo tonight shall lie
his old betrothed but despised
so disguise shall by the disguised
pay with falsehood false exacting
and perform an old contracting
here comes a man of comfort whose advice
hath often stilld my brawling discontent
i cry you mercy sir and well could wish
let me excuse me and believe me so
my mirth it much displeased but pleased my woe
tis good though music oft hath such a charm
to make bad good and good provoke to harm
i pray you tell me hath any body inquired
for me here today much upon this time have
i promised here to meet
i have sat here all day
i do constantly believe you the time is come even
be i will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself
i am always bound to you
very well met and well come
what is the news from this good deputy
he hath a garden circummured with brick
whose western side is with a vineyard backd
and to that vineyard is a planched gate
this other doth command a little door
which from the vineyard to the garden leads
there have i made my promise
upon the heavy middle of the night
to call upon him
but shall you on your knowledge find this way
with whispering and most guilty diligence
in action all of precept he did show me
the way twice oer
are there no other tokens
between you greed concerning her observance
no none but only a repair i the dark
and that i have possessd him my most stay
can be but brief for i have made him know
i have a servant comes with me along
that stays upon me whose persuasion is
i come about my brother
tis well borne up
i have not yet made known to mariana
a word of this what ho within come forth
i pray you be acquainted with this maid
she comes to do you good
i do desire the like
do you persuade yourself that i respect you
good friar i know you do and have found it
take then this your companion by the hand
who hath a story ready for your ear
the vaporous night approaches
willt please you walk aside
o place and greatness millions of false eyes
run with these false and most contrarious quests
make thee the father of their idle dreams
and rack thee in their fancies
welcome how agreed
shell take the enterprise upon her father
if you advise it
it is not my consent
but my entreaty too
little have you to say
when you depart from him but soft and low
remember now my brother
fear me not
nor gentle daughter fear you not at all
to bring you thus together tis no sin
sith that the justice of your title to him
our corns to reap for yet our tithes to sow
come hither sirrah can you cut off a mans head
if the man be a bachelor sir i can but if he be a
married man hes his wifes head and i can never
cut off a womans head
come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a
direct answer tomorrow morning are to die claudio
and barnardine here is in our prison a common
you will take it on you to assist him it shall
redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
with an unpitied whipping for you have been a
notorious bawd
sir i have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind
but yet i will be content to be a lawful hangman i
would be glad to receive some instruction from my
fellow partner
what ho abhorson wheres abhorson there
do you call sir
sirrah heres a fellow will help you tomorrow in
your execution if you think it meet compound with
him by the year and let him abide here with you if
not use him for the present and dismiss him he
cannot plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd
a bawd sir fie upon him he will discredit our mystery
go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn
the scale
pray sir by your good favourfor surely sir a
good favour you have but that you have a hanging
lookdo you call sir your occupation a mystery
ay sir a mystery
painting sir i have heard say is a mystery and
your whores sir being members of my occupation
but what mystery there should be in hanging if i
should be hanged i cannot imagine
sir it is a mystery
proof
too little for your thief your true man thinks it
big enough if it be too big for your thief your
apparel fits your thief
are you agreed
sir i will serve him for i do find your hangman is
a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth
oftener ask forgiveness
you sirrah provide your block and your axe
tomorrow four oclock
come on bawd i will instruct thee in my trade follow
occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find
me yare for truly sir for your kindness i owe you
a good turn
the one has my pity not a jot the other
being a murderer though he were my brother
tis now dead midnight and by eight tomorrow
thou must be made immortal wheres barnardine
as fast lockd up in sleep as guiltless labour
he will not wake
who can do good on him
well go prepare yourself
but hark what noise
heaven give your spirits comfort
by and by
i hope it is some pardon or reprieve
for the most gentle claudio
welcome father
the best and wholesomest spirts of the night
envelope you good provost who calld here of late
none since the curfew rung
not isabel
no
they will then eret be long
what comfort is for claudio
theres some in hope
it is a bitter deputy
not so not so his life is paralleld
he doth with holy abstinence subdue
that in himself which he spurs on his power
which he corrects then were he tyrannous
but this being so hes just
now are they come
the steeled gaoler is the friend of men
how now what noise that spirits possessed with haste
that wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes
there he must stay until the officer
have you no countermand for claudio yet
but he must die tomorrow
none sir none
as near the dawning provost as it is
you shall hear more ere morning
happily
you something know yet i believe there comes
besides upon the very siege of justice
lord angelo hath to the public ear
professd the contrary
this is his lordships man
and here comes claudios pardon
i shall obey him
i told you lord angelo belike thinking me remiss
in mine office awakens me with this unwonted
puttingon methinks strangely for he hath not used it before
pray you lets hear
what is that barnardine who is to be executed in the
afternoon
a bohemian born but here nursed un and bred one
that is a prisoner nine years old
how came it that the absent duke had not either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him i
have heard it was ever his manner to do so
indeed his fact till now in the government of lord
angelo came not to an undoubtful proof
it is now apparent
most manifest and not denied by himself
hath he born himself penitently in prison how
seems he to be touched
a man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless
of whats past present or to come insensible of
mortality and desperately mortal
he wants advice
of the prison give him leave to escape hence he
entirely drunk we have very oft awaked him as if
to carry him to execution and showed him a seeming
more of him anon there is written in your brow
truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the
boldness of my cunning i will lay myself in hazard
claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is
no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath
sentenced him to make you understand this in a
manifested effect i crave but four days respite
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy
pray sir in what
in the delaying death
a lack how may i do it having the hour limited
and an express command under penalty to deliver
his head in the view of angelo i may make my case
as claudios to cross this in the smallest
by the vow of mine order i warrant you if my
instructions may be your guide let this barnardine
be this morning executed and his head born to angelo
angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour
o deaths a great disguiser and you may add to it
shave the head and tie the beard and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
fall to you upon this more than thanks and good
fortune by the saint whom i profess i will plead
against it with my life
pardon me good father it is against my oath
were you sworn to the duke or to the deputy
to him and to his substitutes
you will think you have made no offence if the duke
avouch the justice of your dealing
but what likelihood is in that
not a resemblance but a certainty yet since i see
you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you i will go
further than i meant to pluck all fears out of you
look you sir here is the hand and seal of the
signet is not strange to you
i know them both
shall anon overread it at your pleasure where you
shall find within these two days he will be here
this is a thing that angelo knows not for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor
perchance of the dukes death perchance entering
into some monastery but by chance nothing of what
is writ look the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd put not yourself into amazement how these

a creature unprepared unmeet for death
and to transport him in the mind he is
were damnable
here in the prison father
there died this morning of a cruel fever
one ragozine a most notorious pirate
a man of claudios years his beard and head
just of his colour what if we do omit
this reprobate till he were well inclined
and satisfy the deputy with the visage
of ragozine more like to claudio
o tis an accident that heaven provides
dispatch it presently the hour draws on
and sent according to command whiles i
persuade this rude wretch willingly to die
this shall be done good father presently
and how shall we continue claudio
to save me from the danger that might come
if he were known alive
let this be done
ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
to the under generation you shall find
your safety manifested
i am your free dependant
quick dispatch and send the head to angelo
now will i write letters to angelo
the provost he shall bear them whose contents
shall witness to him i am near at home
and that by great injunctions i am bound
to meet me at the consecrated fount
a league below the city and from thence
by cold gradation and wellbalanced form
we shall proceed with angelo
here is the head ill carry it myself
convenient is it make a swift return
for i would commune with you of such things
that want no ear but yours
ill make all speed
the tongue of isabel shes come to know
but i will keep her ignorant of her good
to make her heavenly comforts of despair
when it is least expected
ho by your leave
good morning to you fair and gracious daughter
the better given me by so holy a man
hath yet the deputy sent my brothers pardon
his head is off and sent to angelo
nay but it is not so
in your close patience
o i will to him and pluck out his eyes
you shall not be admitted to his sight
unhappy claudio wretched isabel
injurious world most damned angelo
this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot
forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven
mark what i say which you shall find
the duke comes home tomorrow nay dry your eyes
one of our convent and his confessor
notice to escalus and angelo
who do prepare to meet him at the gates
there to give up their power if you can pace your wisdom
in that good path that i would wish it go
and you shall have your bosom on this wretch
grace of the duke revenges to your heart
and general honour
i am directed by you
this letter then to friar peter give
say by this token i desire his company
at marianas house tonight her cause and yours
ill perfect him withal and he shall bring you
before the duke and to the head of angelo
accuse him home and home for my poor self
i am combined by a sacred vow
command these fretting waters from your eyes
with a light heart trust not my holy order
if i pervert your course whos here
good even friar wheres the provost
not within sir
o pretty isabella i am pale at mine heart to see
to dine and sup with water and bran i dare not for
my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set
me to t but they say the duke will be here
if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
at home he had lived
sir the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
reports but the best is he lives not in them
hes a better woodman than thou takest him for
well youll answer this one day fare ye well
nay tarry ill go along with thee
i can tell thee pretty tales of the duke
you have told me too many of him already sir if
they be true if not true none were enough
i was once before him for getting a wench with child
did you such a thing
yes marry did i but i was fain to forswear it
they would else have married me to the rotten medlar
sir your company is fairer than honest rest you well
if bawdy talk offend you well have very little of
it nay friar i am a kind of burr i shall stick
every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other
in most uneven and distracted manner his actions
not tainted and why meet him at the gates and
redeliver our authorities there
i guess not
and why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
entering that if any crave redress of injustice
they should exhibit their petitions in the street
complaints and to deliver us from devices
hereafter which shall then have no power to stand
against us
well i beseech you let it be proclaimed betimes
notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
him
i shall sir fare you well
good night
this deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant
and dull to all proceedings a deflowerd maid
and by an eminent body that enforced
the law against it but that her tender shame
will not proclaim against her maiden loss
how might she tongue me yet reason dares her no
for my authority bears of a credent bulk
that no particular scandal once can touch
but it confounds the breather he should have lived
save that riotous youth with dangerous sense
might in the times to come have taen revenge
by so receiving a dishonourd life
with ransom of such shame would yet he had lived
a lack when once our grace we have forgot
these letters at fit time deliver me
the provost knows our purpose and our plot
the matter being afoot keep your instruction
and hold you ever to our special drift
though sometimes you do blench from this to that
as cause doth minister go call at flavius house
to valentinus rowland and to crassus
and bid them bring the trumpets to the gate
but send me flavius first
it shall be speeded well
come we will walk theres other of our friends
will greet us here anon my gentle varrius
i would say the truth but to accuse him so
he says to veil full purpose
be ruled by him
besides he tells me that if peradventure
he speak against me on the adverse side
i should not think it strange for tis a physic
thats bitter to sweet end
i would friar peter
o peace the friar is come
come i have found you out a stand most fit
where you may have such vantage on the duke
he shall not pass you twice have the trumpets sounded
the generous and gravest citizens
have hent the gates and very near upon
my very worthy cousin fairly met
our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you
happy return be to your royal grace
many and hearty thankings to you both
we have made inquiry of you and we hear
such goodness of your justice that our soul
cannot but yield you forth to public thanks
forerunning more requital
you make my bonds still greater
o your desert speaks loud and i should wrong it
to lock it in the wards of covert bosom
when it deserves with characters of brass
a forted residence gainst the tooth of time
and razure of oblivion give me your hand
and let the subject see to make them know
that outward courtesies would fain proclaim
favours that keep within come escalus
you must walk by us on our other hand
and good supporters are you
justice o royal duke vail your regard
upon a wrongd i would fain have said a maid
o worthy prince dishonour not your eye
by throwing it on any other object
till you have heard me in my true complaint
and given me justice justice justice justice
relate your wrongs in what by whom be brief
reveal yourself to him
o worthy duke
hear me yourself for that which i must speak
must either punish me not being believed
or wring redress from you hear me o hear me here
she hath been a suitor to me for her brother
cut off by course of justice
by course of justice
and she will speak most bitterly and strange
that angelos forsworn is it not strange
that angelos a murderer is t not strange
that angelo is an adulterous thief
an hypocrite a virginviolator
is it not strange and strange
nay it is ten times strange
it is not truer he is angelo
nay it is ten times true for truth is truth
to the end of reckoning
away with her poor soul
she speaks this in the infirmity of sense
o prince i conjure thee as thou believest
there is another comfort than this world
that thou neglect me not with that opinion
that i am touchd with madness make not impossible
but one the wickedst caitiff on the ground
may seem as shy as grave as just as absolute
as angelo even so may angelo
in all his dressings characts titles forms
if he be less hes nothing but hes more
had i more name for badness
by mine honesty
if she be madas i believe no other
her madness hath the oddest frame of sense
such a dependency of thing on thing
as eer i heard in madness
o gracious duke
harp not on that nor do not banish reason
for inequality but let your reason serve
to make the truth appear where it seems hid
and hide the false seems true
many that are not mad
have sure more lack of reason what would you say
i am the sister of one claudio
condemnd upon the act of fornication
i in probation of a sisterhood
was sent to by my brother one lucio
as then the messenger
i came to her from claudio and desired her
to try her gracious fortune with lord angelo
for her poor brothers pardon
thats he indeed
you were not bid to speak
no my good lord
nor wishd to hold my peace
i wish you now then
a business for yourself pray heaven you then
be perfect
i warrant your honour
the warrants for yourself take heed tot
this gentleman told somewhat of my tale
right
it may be right but you are i the wrong
to speak before your time proceed
i went
to this pernicious caitiff deputy
thats somewhat madly spoken
pardon it
the phrase is to the matter
mended again the matter proceed
in brief to set the needless process by
how i persuaded how i prayd and kneeld
how he refelld me and how i replied
for this was of much lengththe vile conclusion
he would not but by gift of my chaste body
to his concupiscible intemperate lust
release my brother and after much debatement
my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour
his purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant
for my poor brothers head
this is most likely
o that it were as like as it is true
by heaven fond wretch thou knowist not what thou speakst
or else thou art subornd against his honour
in hateful practise first his integrity
stands without blemish next it imports no reason
that with such vehemency he should pursue
he would have weighd thy brother by himself
confess the truth and say by whose advice
thou camest here to complain
and is this all
then o you blessed ministers above
keep me in patience and with ripend time
unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
in countenance heaven shield your grace from woe
as i thus wrongd hence unbelieved go
i know yould fain be gone an officer
to prison with her shall we thus permit
a blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
on him so near us this needs must be a practise
who knew of your intent and coming hither
one that i would were here friar lodowick
a ghostly father belike who knows that lodowick
my lord i know him tis a meddling friar
for certain words he spake against your grace
in your retirement i had swinged him soundly
words against me this is a good friar belike
and to set on this wretched woman here
against our substitute let this friar be found
but yesternight my lord she and that friar
a very scurvy fellow
blessed be your royal grace
i have stood by my lord and i have heard
your royal ear abused first hath this woman
most wrongfully accused your substitute
who is as free from touch or soil with her
as she from one ungot
we did believe no less
know you that friar lodowick that she speaks of
i know him for a man divine and holy
not scurvy nor a temporary meddler
as hes reported by this gentleman
and on my trust a man that never yet
did as he vouches misreport your grace
my lord most villanously believe it
well he in time may come to clear himself
but at this instant he is sick my lord
of a strange fever upon his mere request
being come to knowledge that there was complaint
intended gainst lord angelo came i hither
to speak as from his mouth what he doth know
is true and false and what he with his oath
and all probation will make up full clear
whensoever hes convented first for this woman
to justify this worthy nobleman
so vulgarly and personally accused
her shall you hear disproved to her eyes
till she herself confess it
good friar lets hear it
do you not smile at this lord angelo
o heaven the vanity of wretched fools
give us some seats come cousin angelo
in this ill be impartial be you judge
of your own cause is this the witness friar
first let her show her face and after speak
pardon my lord i will not show my face
until my husband bid me
what are you married
no my lord
are you a maid
no my lord
a widow then
neither my lord
my lord she may be a punk for many of them are
neither maid widow nor wife
to prattle for himself
well my lord
my lord i do confess i neer was married
i have known my husband yet my husband
knows not that ever he knew me
for the benefit of silence would thou wert so too
well my lord
this is no witness for lord angelo
now i come tot my lord
she that accuses him of fornication
in selfsame manner doth accuse my husband
and charges him my lord with such a time
when ill depose i had him in mine arms
with all the effect of love
charges she more than me
not that i know
no you say your husband
why just my lord and that is angelo
who thinks he knows that he neer knew my body
but knows he thinks that he knows isabels
this is a strange abuse lets see thy face
my husband bids me now i will unmask
this is that face thou cruel angelo
which once thou sworest was worth the looking on
this is the hand which with a vowd contract
was fast belockd in thine this is the body
that took away the match from isabel
and did supply thee at thy gardenhouse
in her imagined person
know you this woman
carnally she says
sirrah no more
enough my lord
and five years since there was some speech of marriage
betwixt myself and her which was broke off
partly for that her promised proportions
came short of composition but in chief
for that her reputation was disvalued
i never spake with her saw her nor heard from her
upon my faith and honour
noble prince
as there comes light from heaven and words from breath
as there is sense in truth and truth in virtue
i am affianced this mans wife as strongly
but tuesday night last gone ins gardenhouse
he knew me as a wife as this is true
let me in safety raise me from my knees
or else for ever be confixed here
a marble monument
now good my lord give me the scope of justice
my patience here is touchd i do perceive
these poor informal women are no more
but instruments of some more mightier member
to find this practise out
ay with my heart
and punish them to your height of pleasure
thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman
compact with her thats gone thinkst thou thy oaths
though they would swear down each particular saint
were testimonies against his worth and credit
thats seald in approbation you lord escalus
sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains
to find out this abuse whence tis derived
there is another friar that set them on
let him be sent for
would he were here my lord for he indeed
your provost knows the place where he abides
and he may fetch him
go do it instantly
and you my noble and wellwarranted cousin
whom it concerns to hear this matter forth
do with your injuries as seems you best
but stir not you till you have well determined
upon these slanderers
my lord well do it throughly
signior lucio did not you say you knew that
friar lodowick to be a dishonest person
but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke
we shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
notable fellow
as any in vienna on my word
call that same isabel here once again i would speak with her
pray you my lord give me leave to question you
shall see how ill handle her
not better than he by her own report

thats the way for women are light at midnight
that you have said
my lord here comes the rascal i spoke of here with
the provost

mum
lord angelo they have confessed you did
tis false
how know you where you are
respect to your great place and let the devil
be sometime honourd for his burning throne
where is the duke tis he should hear me speak
look you speak justly
boldly at least but o poor souls
come you to seek the lamb here of the fox
good night to your redress is the duke gone
then is your cause gone too the dukes unjust
thus to retort your manifest appeal
and put your trial in the villains mouth
which here you come to accuse
this is the rascal this is he i spoke of
why thou unreverend and unhallowd friar
ist not enough thou hast subornd these women
to accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth
and in the witness of his proper ear
to call him villain and then to glance from him
to the duke himself to tax him with injustice
take him hence to the rack with him well touse you
joint by joint but we will know his purpose
what unjust
be not so hot the duke
dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
nor here provincial my business in this state
made me a looker on here in vienna
where i have seen corruption boil and bubble
till it oerrun the stew laws for all faults
but faults so countenanced that the strong statutes
stand like the forfeits in a barbers shop
as much in mock as mark
slander to the state away with him to prison
what can you vouch against him signior lucio
is this the man that you did tell us of
do you know me
met you at the prison in the absence of the duke
o did you so and do you remember what you said of the duke
most notedly sir
do you so sir and was the duke a fleshmonger a
fool and a coward as you then reported him to be
you must sir change persons with me ere you make
much more much worse
o thou damnable fellow did not i pluck thee by the
nose for thy speeches
i protest i love the duke as i love myself
hark how the villain would close now after his
treasonable abuses
such a fellow is not to be talked withal away with
him to prison where is the provost away with him
speak no more away with those giglots too and
with the other confederate companion
what resists he help him lucio
come sir come sir come sir foh sir why you
baldpated lying rascal you must be hooded must

first provost let me bail these gentle three
sneak not away sir for the friar and you
must have a word anon lay hold on him
this may prove worse than hanging
o my dread lord
i should be guiltier than my guiltiness
to think i can be undiscernible
when i perceive your grace like power divine
hath lookd upon my passes then good prince
no longer session hold upon my shame
immediate sentence then and sequent death
is all the grace i beg
come hither mariana

i was my lord
go take her hence and marry her instantly
do you the office friar which consummate
return him here again go with him provost
my lord i am more amazed at his dishonour
than at the strangeness of it
come hither isabel
advertising and holy to your business
not changing heart with habit i am still
attorneyd at your service
o give me pardon
that i your vassal have employd and paind
your unknown sovereignty
and now dear maid be you as free to us
your brothers death i know sits at your heart
and you may marvel why i obscured myself
labouring to save his life and would not rather
make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
than let him so be lost o most kind maid
it was the swift celerity of his death
which i did think with slower foot came on
that braind my purpose but peace be with him
that life is better life past fearing death
so happy is your brother
i do my lord
for this newmarried man approaching here
whose salt imagination yet hath wrongd
your well defended honour you must pardon
being criminal in double violation
of sacred chastity and of promisebreach
thereon dependent for your brothers life
the very mercy of the law cries out
most audible even from his proper tongue
an angelo for claudio death for death
haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure
like doth quit like and measure still for measure
then angelo thy faults thus manifested
which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage
we do condemn thee to the very block
where claudio stoopd to death and with like haste
away with him
o my most gracious lord
i hope you will not mock me with a husband
it is your husband mockd you with a husband
consenting to the safeguard of your honour
i thought your marriage fit else imputation
for that he knew you might reproach your life
and choke your good to come for his possessions
although by confiscation they are ours
we do instate and widow you withal
to buy you a better husband
o my dear lord
i crave no other nor no better man
never crave him we are definitive
gentle my liege
you do but lose your labour
away with him to death
now sir to you
o my good lord sweet isabel take my part
lend me your knees and all my life to come
ill lend you all my life to do you service
should she kneel down in mercy of this fact
her brothers ghost his paved bed would break
and take her hence in horror
isabel
sweet isabel do yet but kneel by me
hold up your hands say nothing ill speak all
they say best men are moulded out of faults
and for the most become much more the better
o isabel will you not lend a knee
he dies for claudios death
most bounteous sir
look if it please you on this man condemnd
a due sincerity governd his deeds
let him not die my brother had but justice
for angelo
his act did not oertake his bad intent
and must be buried but as an intent
intents but merely thoughts
merely my lord
your suits unprofitable stand up i say
i have bethought me of another fault
provost how came it claudio was beheaded
at an unusual hour
it was commanded so
had you a special warrant for the deed
no my good lord it was by private message
give up your keys
i thought it was a fault but knew it not
yet did repent me after more advice
for testimony whereof one in the prison
that should by private order else have died
i have reserved alive
whats he
his name is barnardine
i would thou hadst done so by claudio
go fetch him hither let me look upon him
i am sorry one so learned and so wise
as you lord angelo have still appeard
should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood
and lack of temperd judgment afterward
and so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
that i crave death more willingly than mercy
tis my deserving and i do entreat it
which is that barnardine
this my lord
there was a friar told me of this man
sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul
that apprehends no further than this world
but for those earthly faults i quit them all
and pray thee take this mercy to provide
for better times to come friar advise him
i leave him to your hand what muffled fellows that
this is another prisoner that i saved
who should have died when claudio lost his head
as like almost to claudio as himself
faith my lord i spoke it but according to the
trick if you will hang me for it you may but i
had rather it would please you i might be whipt
whipt first sir and hanged after
proclaim it provost round about the city
is any woman wrongd by this lewd fellow
as i have heard him swear himself theres one
whom he begot with child let her appear
let him be whipt and hangd
i beseech your highness do not marry me to a whore
good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold
upon mine honour thou shalt marry her
thy slanders i forgive and therewithal
remit thy other forfeits take him to prison
and see our pleasure herein executed
marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death
whipping and hanging
slandering a prince deserves it
she claudio that you wrongd look you restore
i have confessd her and i know her virtue
theres more behind that is more gratulate
we shill employ thee in a worthier place
forgive him angelo that brought you home
the offence pardons itself dear isabel
i have a motion much imports your good
whereto if youll a willing ear incline
whats mine is yours and what is yours is mine
so bring us to our palace where well show
whats yet behind thats meet you all should know
ill pheeze you in faith
a pair of stocks you rogue
the chronicles we came in with richard conqueror
you will not pay for the glasses you have burst
bed and warm thee
i know my remedy i must go fetch the
thirdborough
third or fourth or fifth borough ill answer him
and kindly
brach merriman the poor cur is embossd
and couple clowder with the deepmouthd brach
sawst thou not boy how silver made it good
at the hedgecorner in the coldest fault
i would not lose the dog for twenty pound
why belman is as good as he my lord
he cried upon it at the merest loss
trust me i take him for the better dog
i would esteem him worth a dozen such
tomorrow i intend to hunt again
i will my lord
whats here one dead or drunk see doth he breathe
he breathes my lord were he not warmd with ale
this were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly
o monstrous beast how like a swine he lies
grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image
sirs i will practise on this drunken man
what think you if he were conveyd to bed
wrappd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers
a most delicious banquet by his bed
and brave attendants near him when he wakes
would not the beggar then forget himself
believe me lord i think he cannot choose
it would seem strange unto him when he waked
even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy
carry him gently to my fairest chamber
balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
procure me music ready when he wakes
to make a dulcet and a heavenly sound
and if he chance to speak be ready straight
and with a low submissive reverence
say what is it your honour will command
let one attend him with a silver basin
full of rosewater and bestrewd with flowers
another bear the ewer the third a diaper
and say willt please your lordship cool your hands
some one be ready with a costly suit
and ask him what apparel he will wear
another tell him of his hounds and horse
persuade him that he hath been lunatic
and when he says he is say that he dreams
for he is nothing but a mighty lord
it will be pastime passing excellent
if it be husbanded with modesty
my lord i warrant you we will play our part
as he shall think by our true diligence
he is no less than what we say he is
take him up gently and to bed with him
and each one to his office when he wakes
belike some noble gentleman that means
travelling some journey to repose him here
how now who is it
ant please your honour players
that offer service to your lordship
bid them come near
now fellows you are welcome
we thank your honour
do you intend to stay with me tonight
so please your lordship to accept our duty
with all my heart this fellow i remember
i have forgot your name but sure that part
was aptly fitted and naturally performd
i think twas soto that your honour means
well you are come to me in a happy time
the rather for i have some sport in hand
wherein your cunning can assist me much
but i am doubtful of your modesties
lest overeyeing of his odd behavior
for yet his honour never heard a play
you break into some merry passion
and so offend him for i tell you sirs
if you should smile he grows impatient
were he the veriest antic in the world
go sirrah take them to the buttery
let them want nothing that my house affords
sirrah go you to bartholmew my page
that done conduct him to the drunkards chamber
and call him madam do him obeisance
tell him from me as he will win my love
he bear himself with honourable action
such as he hath observed in noble ladies
such duty to the drunkard let him do
with soft low tongue and lowly courtesy
and say what ist your honour will command
wherein your lady and your humble wife
may show her duty and make known her love
and then with kind embracements tempting kisses
and with declining head into his bosom
bid him shed tears as being overjoyd
to see her noble lord restored to health
who for this seven years hath esteemd him
and if the boy have not a womans gift
to rain a shower of commanded tears
an onion will do well for such a shift
which in a napkin being close conveyd
shall in despite enforce a watery eye
anon ill give thee more instructions
i know the boy will well usurp the grace
i long to hear him call the drunkard husband
and how my men will stay themselves from laughter
when they do homage to this simple peasant
ill in to counsel them haply my presence
may well abate the overmerry spleen
which otherwise would grow into extremes
for gods sake a pot of small ale
willt please your lordship drink a cup of sack
willt please your honour taste of these conserves
what raiment will your honour wear today
i am christophero sly call not me honour nor
you give me any conserves give me conserves of
have no more doublets than backs no more stockings
than legs nor no more shoes than feet nay
sometimes more feet than shoes or such shoes as my
toes look through the overleather
heaven cease this idle humour in your honour
o that a mighty man of such descent
of such possessions and so high esteem
should be infused with so foul a spirit
what would you make me mad am not i christopher
sly old slys son of burtonheath by birth a
pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a
bearherd and now by present profession a tinker
ask marian hacket the fat alewife of wincot if
on the score for sheer ale score me up for the
lyingest knave in christendom what i am not
o this it is that makes your lady mourn
o this is it that makes your servants droop
hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house
as beaten hence by your strange lunacy
o noble lord bethink thee of thy birth
call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
and banish hence these abject lowly dreams
look how thy servants do attend on thee
each in his office ready at thy beck
wilt thou have music hark apollo plays
or wilt thou sleep well have thee to a couch
softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
on purpose trimmd up for semiramis
or wilt thou ride thy horses shall be trappd
their harness studded all with gold and pearl
dost thou love hawking thou hast hawks will soar
above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt
thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
and fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth
say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift
as breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe
dost thou love pictures we will fetch thee straight
adonis painted by a running brook
and cytherea all in sedges hid
which seem to move and wanton with her breath
even as the waving sedges play with wind
well show thee io as she was a maid
and how she was beguiled and surprised
as lively painted as the deed was done
or daphne roaming through a thorny wood
scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds
and at that sight shall sad apollo weep
so workmanly the blood and tears are drawn
thou hast a lady far more beautiful
than any woman in this waning age
and till the tears that she hath shed for thee
like envious floods oerrun her lovely face
she was the fairest creature in the world
and yet she is inferior to none
am i a lord and have i such a lady
or do i dream or have i dreamd till now
upon my life i am a lord indeed
and not a tinker nor christophero sly
well bring our lady hither to our sight
and once again a pot o the smallest ale
willt please your mightiness to wash your hands
o how we joy to see your wit restored
o that once more you knew but what you are
these fifteen years you have been in a dream
or when you waked so waked as if you slept
these fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap
but did i never speak of all that time
for though you lay here in this goodly chamber
yet would you say ye were beaten out of door
and rail upon the hostess of the house
and say you would present her at the leet
sometimes you would call out for cicely hacket
ay the womans maid of the house
why sir you know no house nor no such maid
nor no such men as you have reckond up
as stephen sly and did john naps of greece
and peter turph and henry pimpernell
and twenty more such names and men as these
which never were nor no man ever saw
now lord be thanked for my good amends
amen
how fares my noble lord
marry i fare well for here is cheer enough
where is my wife
are you my wife and will not call me husband
my husband and my lord my lord and husband
i am your wife in all obedience
i know it well what must i call her
madam
alce madam or joan madam
call ladies
madam wife they say that i have dreamd
and slept above some fifteen year or more
ay and the time seems thirty unto me
being all this time abandond from your bed
tis much servants leave me and her alone
madam undress you and come now to bed
thrice noble lord let me entreat of you
to pardon me yet for a night or two
for your physicians have expressly charged
in peril to incur your former malady
i hope this reason stands for my excuse
ay it stands so that i may hardly
tarry so long but i would be loath to fall into
despite of the flesh and the blood
your honours players heating your amendment
are come to play a pleasant comedy
for so your doctors hold it very meet
seeing too much sadness hath congeald your blood
therefore they thought it good you hear a play
and frame your mind to mirth and merriment
which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life
marry i will let them play it is not a
comondy a christmas gambold or a tumblingtrick
no my good lord it is more pleasing stuff
what household stuff
it is a kind of history
well well seet come madam wife sit by my side
tranio since for the great desire i had
to see fair padua nursery of arts
i am arrived for fruitful lombardy
the pleasant garden of great italy
and by my fathers love and leave am armd
with his good will and thy good company
my trusty servant well approved in all
here let us breathe and haply institute
a course of learning and ingenious studies
pisa renownd for grave citizens
gave me my being and my father first
a merchant of great traffic through the world
vincetino come of bentivolii
vincetinos son brought up in florence
it shall become to serve all hopes conceived
and therefore tranio for the time i study
virtue and that part of philosophy
will i apply that treats of happiness
by virtue specially to be achieved
tell me thy mind for i have pisa left
and am to padua come as he that leaves
a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
mi perdonato gentle master mine
i am in all affected as yourself
glad that you thus continue your resolve
to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
only good master while we do admire
this virtue and this moral discipline
lets be no stoics nor no stocks i pray
or so devote to aristotles cheques
balk logic with acquaintance that you have
and practise rhetoric in your common talk
music and poesy use to quicken you
the mathematics and the metaphysics
fall to them as you find your stomach serves you
in brief sir study what you most affect
gramercies tranio well dost thou advise
if biondello thou wert come ashore
we could at once put us in readiness
and take a lodging fit to entertain
such friends as time in padua shall beget
master some show to welcome us to town
gentlemen importune me no farther
for how i firmly am resolved you know
that is not bestow my youngest daughter
if either of you both love katharina
because i know you well and love you well
leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure
i pray you sir is it your will
to make a stale of me amongst these mates
mates maid how mean you that no mates for you
unless you were of gentler milder mould
i wis it is not half way to her heart
but if it were doubt not her care should be
to comb your noddle with a threeleggd stool
and paint your face and use you like a fool
from all such devils good lord deliver us
and me too good lord
that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward
but in the others silence do i see
maids mild behavior and sobriety
peace tranio
well said master mum and gaze your fill
gentlemen that i may soon make good
and let it not displease thee good bianca
for i will love thee neer the less my girl
a pretty peat it is best
put finger in the eye an she knew why
sister content you in my discontent
my books and instruments shall be my company
on them to took and practise by myself
hark tranio thou mayst hear minerva speak
signior baptista will you be so strange
sorry am i that our good will effects
biancas grief
why will you mew her up
signior baptista for this fiend of hell
and make her bear the penance of her tongue
and for i know she taketh most delight
in music instruments and poetry
schoolmasters will i keep within my house
fit to instruct her youth if you hortensio
or signior gremio you know any such
prefer them hither for to cunning men
i will be very kind and liberal
and so farewell katharina you may stay
for i have more to commune with bianca
why and i trust i may go too may i not what
shall i be appointed hours as though belike i
knew not what to take and what to leave ha
good heres none will hold you their love is not
so great hortensio but we may blow our nails
sweet bianca if i can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights i will
wish him to her father
though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both
that we may yet again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in biancos love to
labour and effect one thing specially
whats that i pray
marry sir to get a husband for her sister
a husband a devil
i say a husband
i say a devil thinkest thou hortensio though
her father be very rich any man is so very a fool
to be married to hell
tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine
to endure her loud alarums why man there be good
fellows in the world an a man could light on them
would take her with all faults and money enough
i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with
this condition to be whipped at the high cross
every morning
faith as you say theres small choice in rotten
apples but come since this bar in law makes us
friends it shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping baptistas eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband
and then have tot a fresh sweet bianca happy man
be his dole he that runs fastest gets the ring
how say you signior gremio
i am agreed and would i had given him the best
horse in padua to begin his wooing that would
thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her come on
i pray sir tell me is it possible
that love should of a sudden take such hold
o tranio till i found it to be true
i never thought it possible or likely
but see while idly i stood looking on
and now in plainness do confess to thee
that art to me as secret and as dear
as anna to the queen of carthage was
tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio
if i achieve not this young modest girl
counsel me tranio for i know thou canst
assist me tranio for i know thou wilt
master it is no time to chide you now
if love have touchd you nought remains but so
redime te captum quam queas minimo
the rest will comfort for thy counsels sound
master you lookd so longly on the maid
perhaps you markd not whats the pith of all
o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face
such as the daughter of agenor had
that made great jove to humble him to her hand
when with his knees he kissd the cretan strand
saw you no more markd you not how her sister
began to scold and raise up such a storm
that mortal ears might hardly endure the din
tranio i saw her coral lips to move
sacred and sweet was all i saw in her
nay then tis time to stir him from his trance
her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
that till the father rid his hands of her
master your love must live a maid at home
and therefore has he closely mewd her up
because she will not be annoyd with suitors
ah tranio what a cruel fathers he
but art thou not advised he took some care
to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
ay marry am i sir and now tis plotted
i have it tranio
master for my hand
both our inventions meet and jump in one
tell me thine first
you will be schoolmaster
thats your device
not possible for who shall bear your part
and be in padua here vincentios son
keep house and ply his book welcome his friends
visit his countrymen and banquet them
basta content thee for i have it full
we have not yet been seen in any house
nor can we lie distinguishd by our faces
for man or master then it follows thus
thou shalt be master tranio in my stead
i will some other be some florentine
some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa
when biondello comes he waits on thee
but i will charm him first to keep his tongue
so had you need
in brief sir sith it your pleasure is
and i am tied to be obedient
for so your father charged me at our parting
be serviceable to my son quoth he
although i think twas in another sense
i am content to be lucentio
because so well i love lucentio
and let me be a slave to achieve that maid
whose sudden sight hath thralld my wounded eye
here comes the rogue
sirrah where have you been
where have i been nay how now where are you
master has my fellow tranio stolen your clothes or
you stolen his or both pray whats the news
and therefore frame your manners to the time
your fellow tranio here to save my life
puts my apparel and my countenance on
and i for my escape have put on his
for in a quarrel since i came ashore
wait you on him i charge you as becomes
you understand me
i sir neer a whit
tranio is changed into lucentio
so could i faith boy to have the next wish after
that lucentio indeed had baptistas youngest daughter
but sirrah not for my sake but your masters i advise
when i am alone why then i am tranio
but in all places else your master lucentio
thou ask me why sufficeth my reasons are both good
and weighty
my lord you nod you do not mind the play
comes there any more of it
my lord tis but begun
would twere done
verona for a while i take my leave
to see my friends in padua but of all
my best beloved and approved friend
hortensio and i trow this is his house
here sirrah grumio knock i say

rebused your worship

i should knock you here sir
villain i say knock me at this gate
and rap me well or ill knock your knaves pate
my master is grown quarrelsome i should knock

will it not be
faith sirrah an youll not knock ill ring it
ill try how you can sol fa and sing it
help masters help my master is mad
now knock when i bid you sirrah villain
how now whats the matter my old friend grumio
and my good friend petruchio how do you all at verona
signior hortensio come you to part the fray
con tutto il cuore ben trovato may i say
alla nostra casa ben venuto molto honorato signor
this quarrel
nay tis no matter sir what he leges in latin
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap
use his master so being perhaps for aught i see
two and thirty a pip out whom would to god i had
well knockd at first then had not grumio come by the worst
a senseless villain good hortensio
i bade the rascal knock upon your gate
and could not get him for my heart to do it
knock at the gate o heavens spake you not these
words plain sirrah knock me here rap me here
knock me well and knock me soundly and come you
now with knocking at the gate
sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you
why thiss a heavy chance twixt him and you
your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio
and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale
blows you to padua here from old verona
such wind as scatters young men through the world
to seek their fortunes farther than at home
where small experience grows but in a few
antonio my father is deceased
and i have thrust myself into this maze
crowns in my purse i have and goods at home
and so am come abroad to see the world
petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee
and wish thee to a shrewd illfavourd wife
and yet ill promise thee she shall be rich
and ill not wish thee to her
signior hortensio twixt such friends as we
few words suffice and therefore if thou know
one rich enough to be petruchios wife
as wealth is burden of my wooing dance
be she as foul as was florentius love
as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd
as socrates xanthippe or a worse
she moves me not or not removes at least
affections edge in me were she as rough
i come to wive it wealthily in padua
if wealthily then happily in padua
nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his
a puppet or an agletbaby or an old trot with neer
a tooth in her head though she have as many diseases
so money comes withal
petruchio since we are steppd thus far in
i will continue that i broachd in jest
i can petruchio help thee to a wife
with wealth enough and young and beauteous
her only fault and that is faults enough
is that she is intolerable curst
and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure
that were my state far worser than it is
i would not wed her for a mine of gold
tell me her fathers name and tis enough
for i will board her though she chide as loud
as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
her father is baptista minola
her name is katharina minola
renownd in padua for her scolding tongue
i know her father though i know not her
and he knew my deceased father well
i will not sleep hortensio till i see her
and therefore let me be thus bold with you
to give you over at this first encounter
unless you will accompany me thither
i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts
o my word an she knew him as well as i do she
why thats nothing an he begin once hell rail in
his ropetricks ill tell you what sir an she
stand him but a little he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat
you know him not sir
tarry petruchio i must go with thee
he hath the jewel of my life in hold
his youngest daughter beautiful binaca
and her withholds from me and other more
suitors to her and rivals in my love
supposing it a thing impossible
for those defects i have before rehearsed
that ever katharina will be wood
therefore this order hath baptista taen
that none shall have access unto bianca
till katharina the curst have got a husband
katharina the curst
a title for a maid of all titles the worst
now shall my friend petruchio do me grace
and offer me disguised in sober robes
to old baptista as a schoolmaster
well seen in music to instruct bianca
that so i may by this device at least
have leave and leisure to make love to her
and unsuspected court her by herself
heres no knavery see to beguile the old folks
how the young folks lay their heads together
peace grumio it is the rival of my love
petruchio stand by a while
a proper stripling and an amorous
o very well i have perused the note
all books of love see that at any hand
signior baptistas liberality
ill mend it with a largess take your paper too
and let me have them very well perfumed
for she is sweeter than perfume itself
to whom they go to what will you read to her
whateer i read to her ill plead for you
as for my patron stand you so assured
yea and perhaps with more successful words
than you unless you were a scholar sir
o this learning what a thing it is
o this woodcock what an ass it is
peace sirrah
grumio mum god save you signior gremio
and you are well met signior hortensio
trow you whither i am going to baptista minola
i promised to inquire carefully
and by good fortune i have lighted well
on this young man for learning and behavior
fit for her turn well read in poetry
and other books good ones i warrant ye
tis well and i have met a gentleman
hath promised me to help me to another
a fine musician to instruct our mistress
so shall i no whit be behind in duty
to fair bianca so beloved of me
beloved of me and that my deeds shall prove
and that his bags shall prove
listen to me and if you speak me fair
ill tell you news indifferent good for either
here is a gentleman whom by chance i met
upon agreement from us to his liking
will undertake to woo curst katharina
yea and to marry her if her dowry please
so said so done is well
hortensio have you told him all her faults
if that be all masters i hear no harm
no sayst me so friend what countryman
my father dead my fortune lives for me
and i do hope good days and long to see
o sir such a life with such a wife were strange
you shall have me assisting you in all
but will you woo this wildcat
will i live
will he woo her ay or ill hang her
why came i hither but to that intent
think you a little din can daunt mine ears
have i not in my time heard lions roar
have i not heard the sea puffd up with winds
rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
have i not heard great ordnance in the field
and heavens artillery thunder in the skies
have i not in a pitched battle heard
loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang
and do you tell me of a womans tongue
that gives not half so great a blow to hear
as will a chestnut in a farmers fire
tush tush fear boys with bugs
for he fears none
this gentleman is happily arrived
my mind presumes for his own good and ours
i promised we would be contributors
and bear his charging of wooing whatsoeer
and so we will provided that he win her
i would i were as sure of a good dinner
gentlemen god save you if i may be bold
tell me i beseech you which is the readiest way
to the house of signior baptista minola
even he biondello
hark you sir you mean not her to
not her that chides sir at any hand i pray
i love no chiders sir biondello lets away
well begun tranio
sir a word ere you go
are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no
and if i be sir is it any offence
no if without more words you will get you hence
why sir i pray are not the streets as free
for me as for you
but so is not she
for what reason i beseech you
for this reason if youll know
that shes the choice love of signior gremio
that shes the chosen of signior hortensio
softly my masters if you be gentlemen
do me this right hear me with patience
baptista is a noble gentleman
to whom my father is not all unknown
and were his daughter fairer than she is
she may more suitors have and me for one
fair ledas daughter had a thousand wooers
and so she shall lucentio shall make one
though paris came in hope to speed alone
what this gentleman will outtalk us all
hortensio to what end are all these words
sir let me be so bold as ask you
did you yet ever see baptistas daughter
no sir but hear i do that he hath two
the one as famous for a scolding tongue
as is the other for beauteous modesty
sir sir the firsts for me let her go by
yea leave that labour to great hercules
and let it be more than alcides twelve
the youngest daughter whom you hearken for
her father keeps from all access of suitors
and will not promise her to any man
the younger then is free and not before
if it be so sir that you are the man
must stead us all and me amongst the rest
and if you break the ice and do this feat
achieve the elder set the younger free
for our access whose hap shall be to have her
will not so graceless be to be ingrate
sir you say well and well you do conceive
and since you do profess to be a suitor
you must as we do gratify this gentleman
to whom we all rest generally beholding
please ye we may contrive this afternoon
and quaff carouses to our mistress health
and do as adversaries do in law
strive mightily but eat and drink as friends
o excellent motion fellows lets be gone
the motions good indeed and be it so
petruchio i shall be your ben venuto
good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself
to make a bondmaid and a slave of me
unbind my hands ill pull them off myself
yea all my raiment to my petticoat
or what you will command me will i do
so well i know my duty to my elders
of all thy suitors here i charge thee tell
believe me sister of all the men alive
i never yet beheld that special face
which i could fancy more than any other
minion thou liest ist not hortensio
if you affect him sister here i swear
ill plead for you myself but you shall have
him
you will have gremio to keep you fair
is it for him you do envy me so
nay then you jest and now i well perceive
i prithee sister kate untie my hands
if that be jest then all the rest was so
why how now dame whence grows this insolence
bianca stand aside poor girl she weeps
go ply thy needle meddle not with her
for shame thou helding of a devilish spirit
why dost thou wrong her that did neer wrong thee
when did she cross thee with a bitter word
her silence flouts me and ill be revenged
what in my sight bianca get thee in
what will you not suffer me nay now i see
she is your treasure she must have a husband
i must dance barefoot on her wedding day
and for your love to her lead apes in hell
till i can find occasion of revenge
was ever gentleman thus grieved as i
but who comes here
good morrow neighbour baptista
good morrow neighbour gremio
god save you gentlemen
and you good sir pray have you not a daughter
calld katharina fair and virtuous
i have a daughter sir called katharina
i am a gentleman of verona sir
that hearing of her beauty and her wit
her affability and bashful modesty
her wondrous qualities and mild behavior
am bold to show myself a forward guest
within your house to make mine eye the witness
of that report which i so oft have heard
and for an entrance to my entertainment
i do present you with a man of mine
cunning in music and the mathematics
to instruct her fully in those sciences
his name is licio born in mantua
youre welcome sir and he for your good sake
but for my daughter katharina this i know
she is not for your turn the more my grief
i see you do not mean to part with her
or else you like not of my company
mistake me not i speak but as i find
whence are you sir what may i call your name
petruchio is my name antonios son
a man well known throughout all italy
saving your tale petruchio i pray
baccare you are marvellous forward
o pardon me signior gremio i would fain be doing
i doubt it not sir but you will curse your
wooing neighbour this is a gift very grateful i am
sure of it to express the like kindness myself
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any freely give unto you this young scholar
that hath been long studying at rheims as cunning
in greek latin and other languages as the other
accept his service
a thousand thanks signior gremio
welcome good cambio
may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming
pardon me sir the boldness is mine own
that being a stranger in this city here
do make myself a suitor to your daughter
unto bianca fair and virtuous
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me
in the preferment of the eldest sister
this liberty is all that i request
that upon knowledge of my parentage
i may have welcome mongst the rest that woo
and toward the education of your daughters
i here bestow a simple instrument
if you accept them then their worth is great
lucentio is your name of whence i pray
of pisa sir son to vincentio
a mighty man of pisa by report
take you the lute and you the set of books
you shall go see your pupils presently
holla within
sirrah lead these gentlemen
to my daughters and tell them both
we will go walk a little in the orchard
and then to dinner you are passing welcome
and so i pray you all to think yourselves
signior baptista my business asketh haste
and every day i cannot come to woo
you knew my father well and in him me
left solely heir to all his lands and goods
then tell me if i get your daughters love
what dowry shall i have with her to wife
after my death the one half of my lands
and in possession twenty thousand crowns
and for that dowry ill assure her of
her widowhood be it that she survive me
let specialties be therefore drawn between us
that covenants may be kept on either hand
ay when the special thing is well obtaind
that is her love for that is all in all
i am as peremptory as she proudminded
and where two raging fires meet together
though little fire grows great with little wind
so i to her and so she yields to me
for i am rough and woo not like a babe
well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed
but be thou armd for some unhappy words
ay to the proof as mountains are for winds
that shake not though they blow perpetually
how now my friend why dost thou look so pale
for fear i promise you if i look pale
what will my daughter prove a good musician
i think shell sooner prove a soldier
iron may hold with her but never lutes
why then thou canst not break her to the lute
why no for she hath broke the lute to me
i did but tell her she mistook her frets
and bowd her hand to teach her fingering
when with a most impatient devilish spirit
frets call you these quoth she ill fume
and with that word she struck me on the head
and through the instrument my pate made way
and there i stood amazed for a while
as on a pillory looking through the lute
while she did call me rascal fiddler
and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms
as had she studied to misuse me so
now by the world it is a lusty wench
o how i long to have some chat with her
proceed in practise with my younger daughter
shes apt to learn and thankful for good turns
signior petruchio will you go with us
or shall i send my daughter kate to you
i pray you do
i will attend her here
and woo her with some spirit when she comes
say that she rail why then ill tell her plain
say that she frown ill say she looks as clear
say she be mute and will not speak a word
then ill commend her volubility
if she do bid me pack ill give her thanks
if she deny to wed ill crave the day
when i shall ask the banns and when be married
but here she comes and now petruchio speak
good morrow kate for thats your name i hear
they call me katharina that do talk of me
you lie in faith for you are calld plain kate
and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst
but kate the prettiest kate in christendom
kate of kate hall my superdainty kate
for dainties are all kates and therefore kate
take this of me kate of my consolation
hearing thy mildness praised in every town
thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded
yet not so deeply as to thee belongs
myself am moved to woo thee for my wife
you were a moveable
why whats a moveable
a joindstool
asses are made to bear and so are you
women are made to bear and so are you
no such jade as you if me you mean
alas good kate i will not burden thee
for knowing thee to be but young and light
too light for such a swain as you to catch
and yet as heavy as my weight should be
should be shouldbuzz
well taen and like a buzzard
o slowwingd turtle shall a buzzard take thee
ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard
come come you wasp i faith you are too angry
if i be waspish best beware my sting
my remedy is then to pluck it out
ay if the fool could find it where it lies
who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting in his tail
in his tongue
whose tongue
what with my tongue in your tail nay come again
good kate i am a gentleman
that ill try
i swear ill cuff you if you strike again
if you strike me you are no gentleman
and if no gentleman why then no arms
a herald kate o put me in thy books
what is your crest a coxcomb
a combless cock so kate will be my hen
no cock of mine you crow too like a craven
nay come kate come you must not look so sour

now by saint george i am too young for you
yet you are witherd
tis with cares
i care not
twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen
and now i find report a very liar
for thou are pleasant gamesome passing courteous
thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance
nor bite the lip as angry wenches will
nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk
but thou with mildness entertainst thy wooers
with gentle conference soft and affable
why does the world report that kate doth limp
o slanderous world kate like the hazeltwig
is straight and slender and as brown in hue
as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels
go fool and whom thou keepst command
did ever dian so become a grove
as kate this chamber with her princely gait
o be thou dian and let her be kate
and then let kate be chaste and dian sportful
where did you study all this goodly speech
it is extempore from my motherwit
a witty mother witless else her son
am i not wise
yes keep you warm
and therefore setting all this chat aside
that you shall be my wife your dowry greed on
and will you nill you i will marry you
now kate i am a husband for your turn
for by this light whereby i see thy beauty
thy beauty that doth make me like thee well
thou must be married to no man but me
for i am he am born to tame you kate
and bring you from a wild kate to a kate
conformable as other household kates
i must and will have katharina to my wife
now signior petruchio how speed you with my daughter
how but well sir how but well
it were impossible i should speed amiss
why how now daughter katharina in your dumps
call you me daughter now i promise you
you have showd a tender fatherly regard
to wish me wed to one half lunatic
a madcup ruffian and a swearing jack
that thinks with oaths to face the matter out
if she be curst it is for policy
for shes not froward but modest as the dove
she is not hot but temperate as the morn
for patience she will prove a second grissel
and to conclude we have greed so well together
that upon sunday is the weddingday
ill see thee hangd on sunday first
hark petruchio she says shell see thee
hangd first
is this your speeding nay then good night our part
if she and i be pleased whats that to you
tis bargaind twixt us twain being alone
that she shall still be curst in company
i tell you tis incredible to believe
she hung about my neck and kiss on kiss
she vied so fast protesting oath on oath
that in a twink she won me to her love
o you are novices tis a world to see
how tame when men and women are alone
a meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew
to buy apparel gainst the weddingday
provide the feast father and bid the guests
i will be sure my katharina shall be fine
god send you joy petruchio tis a match
father and wife and gentlemen adieu
we will have rings and things and fine array
and kiss me kate we will be married osunday
was ever match clappd up so suddenly
faith gentlemen now i play a merchants part
and venture madly on a desperate mart
twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
the gain i seek is quiet in the match
no doubt but he hath got a quiet catch
i am your neighbour and was suitor first
and i am one that love bianca more
than words can witness or your thoughts can guess
youngling thou canst not love so dear as i
graybeard thy love doth freeze
but thine doth fry
but youth in ladies eyes that flourisheth
tis deeds must win the prize and he of both
that can assure my daughter greatest dower
shall have my biancas love
say signior gremio what can you assure her
first as you know my house within the city
is richly furnished with plate and gold
basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands
my hangings all of tyrian tapestry
in ivory coffers i have stuffd my crowns
in cypress chests my arras counterpoints
costly apparel tents and canopies
fine linen turkey cushions bossd with pearl
valance of venice gold in needlework
pewter and brass and all things that belong
i have a hundred milchkine to the pail
sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls
and all things answerable to this portion
myself am struck in years i must confess
and if i die tomorrow this is hers
if whilst i live she will be only mine
if i may have your daughter to my wife
ill leave her houses three or four as good
within rich pisa walls as any one
old signior gremio has in padua
besides two thousand ducats by the year
of fruitful land all which shall be her jointure
what have i pinchd you signior gremio
two thousand ducats by the year of land
that she shall have besides an argosy
that now is lying in marseilles road
what have i choked you with an argosy
gremio tis known my father hath no less
than three great argosies besides two galliases
and twice as much whateer thou offerst next
nay i have offerd all i have no more
if you like me she shall have me and mine
why then the maid is mine from all the world
i must confess your offer is the best
and let your father make her the assurance
she is your own else you must pardon me
if you should die before him wheres her dower
and may not young men die as well as old
well gentlemen
now on the sunday following shall bianca
be bride to you if you this assurance
and so i take my leave and thank you both
adieu good neighbour
sirrah young gamester your father were a fool
to give thee all and in his waning age
an old italian fox is not so kind my boy
a vengeance on your crafty witherd hide
yet i have faced it with a card of ten
i see no reason but supposed lucentio
must get a father calld supposed vincentio
do get their children but in this case of wooing
a child shall get a sire if i fail not of my cunning
have you so soon forgot the entertainment
her sister katharina welcomed you withal
but wrangling pedant this is
then give me leave to have prerogative
and when in music we have spent an hour
your lecture shall have leisure for as much
preposterous ass that never read so far
to know the cause why music was ordaind
was it not to refresh the mind of man
after his studies or his usual pain
then give me leave to read philosophy
and while i pause serve in your harmony
sirrah i will not bear these braves of thine
why gentlemen you do me double wrong
i am no breeching scholar in the schools
ill not be tied to hours nor pointed times
but learn my lessons as i please myself
take you your instrument play you the whiles
his lecture will be done ere you have tuned
youll leave his lecture when i am in tune
where left we last
hic ibat simois hic est sigeia tellus
hic steterat priami regia celsa senis

hic ibat as i told you before simois i am
lucentio hic est son unto vincentio of pisa
sigeia tellus disguised thus to get your love
hic steterat and that lucentio that comes
awooing priami is my man tranio regia
bearing my port celsa senis that we might
beguile the old pantaloon
madam my instruments in tune
lets hear o fie the treble jars
spit in the hole man and tune again
simois i know you not hic est sigeia tellus i
trust you not hic steterat priami take heed
he hear us not regia presume not celsa senis

madam tis now in tune
all but the base
the base is right tis the base knave that jars
how fiery and forward our pedant is
pedascule ill watch you better yet
in time i may believe yet i mistrust
was ajax calld so from his grandfather
i must believe my master else i promise you
good masters take it not unkindly pray
that i have been thus pleasant with you both
my lessons make no music in three parts
are you so formal sir well i must wait
and watch withal for but i be deceived
our fine musician groweth amorous
madam before you touch the instrument
to learn the order of my fingering
i must begin with rudiments of art
to teach you gamut in a briefer sort
more pleasant pithy and effectual
and there it is in writing fairly drawn
why i am past my gamut long ago
yet read the gamut of hortensio
mistress your father prays you leave your books
you know tomorrow is the weddingday
farewell sweet masters both i must be gone
faith mistress then i have no cause to stay
yet if thy thoughts bianca be so humble
to cast thy wandering eyes on every stale
hortensio will be quit with thee by changing
to give my hand opposed against my heart
unto a madbrain rudesby full of spleen
who wood in haste and means to wed at leisure
i told you i he was a frantic fool
and to be noted for a merry man
hell woo a thousand point the day of marriage
make feasts invite friends and proclaim the banns
yet never means to wed where he hath wood
now must the world point at poor katharina
and say lo there is mad petruchios wife
if it would please him come and marry her
patience good katharina and baptista too
upon my life petruchio means but well
though he be blunt i know him passing wise
though he be merry yet withal hes honest
would katharina had never seen him though
go girl i cannot blame thee now to weep
for such an injury would vex a very saint
much more a shrew of thy impatient humour
master master news old news and such news as
you never heard of
is it new and old too how may that be
why is it not news to hear of petruchios coming
is he come
why no sir
what then
he is coming
when will he be here
when he stands where i am and sees you there
but say what to thine old news
why petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turned a pair
of boots that have been candlecases one buckled
another laced an old rusty sword taen out of the
townarmory with a broken hilt and chapeless
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred
besides possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine troubled with the lampass infected
with the fashions full of wingdalls sped with
spavins rayed with yellows past cure of the fives
stark spoiled with the staggers begnawn with the
bots swayed in the back and shouldershotten
nearlegged before and with a halfchequed bit
and a headstall of sheeps leather which being
restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots one girth
six time pieced and a womans crupper of velure
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs and here and there pieced with packthread
who comes with him
o sir his lackey for all the world caparisoned
like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boothose on the other gartered with a red
and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty
very monster in apparel and not like a christian
footboy or a gentlemans lackey
tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion
yet oftentimes he goes but meanapparelld
i am glad hes come howsoeer he comes
why sir he comes not
didst thou not say he comes
who that petruchio came
ay that petruchio came
no sir i say his horse comes with him on his back
why thats all one
nay by saint jamy
i hold you a penny
a horse and a man
is more than one
and yet not many
come where be these gallants whos at home
you are welcome sir
and yet i come not well
and yet you halt not
not so well apparelld
as i wish you were
were it better i should rush in thus
but where is kate where is my lovely bride
and wherefore gaze this goodly company
as if they saw some wondrous monument
some comet or unusual prodigy
first were we sad fearing you would not come
now sadder that you come so unprovided
fie doff this habit shame to your estate
an eyesore to our solemn festival
and tells us what occasion of import
hath all so long detaind you from your wife
and sent you hither so unlike yourself
sufficeth i am come to keep my word
though in some part enforced to digress
which at more leisure i will so excuse
as you shall well be satisfied withal
the morning wears tis time we were at church
go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
but thus i trust you will not marry her
could i repair what she will wear in me
as i can change these poor accoutrements
twere well for kate and better for myself
but what a fool am i to chat with you
when i should bid good morrow to my bride
and seal the title with a lovely kiss
we will persuade him be it possible
to put on better ere he go to church
ill after him and see the event of this
but to her love concerneth us to add
as i before unparted to your worship
i am to get a manwhateer he be
it skills not much well fit him to our turn
and he shall be vincentio of pisa
and make assurance here in padua
of greater sums than i have promised
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope
and marry sweet bianca with consent
were it not that my fellowschoolmaster
doth watch biancas steps so narrowly
twere good methinks to steal our marriage
which once performd let all the world say no
ill keep mine own despite of all the world
that by degrees we mean to look into
well overreach the greybeard gremio
the narrowprying father minola
the quaint musician amorous licio
all for my masters sake lucentio
signior gremio came you from the church
as willingly as eer i came from school
and is the bride and bridegroom coming home
a bridegroom say you tis a groom indeed
a grumbling groom and that the girl shall find
curster than she why tis impossible
why hes a devil a devil a very fiend
why shes a devil a devil the devils dam
tut shes a lamb a dove a fool to him
should ask if katharina should be his wife
ay by gogswouns quoth he and swore so loud
that allamazed the priest let fall the book
and as he stoopd again to take it up
the madbraind bridegroom took him such a cuff
now take them up quoth he if any list
what said the wench when he rose again
trembled and shook for why he stampd and swore
as if the vicar meant to cozen him
but after many ceremonies done
he had been aboard carousing to his mates
after a storm quaffd off the muscadel
and threw the sops all in the sextons face
having no other reason
but that his beard grew thin and hungerly
and seemd to ask him sops as he was drinking
this done he took the bride about the neck
and kissd her lips with such a clamorous smack
and i seeing this came thence for very shame
and after me i know the rout is coming
hark hark i hear the minstrels play
i know you think to dine with me today
and have prepared great store of wedding cheer
but so it is my haste doth call me hence

her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me how he swore how she prayed
that never prayed before how i cried how the
horses ran away how her bridle was burst how i
lost my crupper with many things of worthy memory

what no attendance no regard no duty
where is the foolish knave i sent before
here sir as foolish as i was before
you peasant swain you whoreson malthorse drudge
did i not bid thee meet me in the park
and bring along these rascal knaves with thee
nathaniels coat sir was not fully made
and gabriels pumps were all unpinkd i the heel
there was no link to colour peters hat
there were none fine but adam ralph and gregory
the rest were ragged old and beggarly
yet as they are here are they come to meet you
go rascals go and fetch my supper in
where is the life that late i led

you whoreson villain will you let it fall

a whoreson beetleheaded flapeard knave
come kate sit down i know you have a stomach
will you give thanks sweet kate or else shall i
whats this mutton
ay
who brought it
i
tis burnt and so is all the meat
what dogs are these where is the rascal cook
how durst you villains bring it from the dresser
and serve it thus to me that love it not
theretake it to you trenchers cups and all
you heedless joltheads and unmannerd slaves
what do you grumble ill be with you straight
the meat was well if you were so contented
i tell thee kate twas burnt and dried away
and i expressly am forbid to touch it
for it engenders choler planteth anger
and better twere that both of us did fast
since of ourselves ourselves are choleric
than feed it with such overroasted flesh
be patient tomorrow t shall be mended
come i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber
peter didst ever see the like
he kills her in her own humour
where is he
in her chamber making a sermon of continency to her
and rails and swears and rates that she poor soul
knows not which way to stand to look to speak
and sits as one newrisen from a dream
away away for he is coming hither
thus have i politicly begun my reign
and tis my hope to end successfully
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
and till she stoop she must not be fullgorged
for then she never looks upon her lure
another way i have to man my haggard
to make her come and know her keepers call
that is to watch her as we watch these kites
that bate and beat and will not be obedient
she eat no meat today nor none shall eat
last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not
as with the meat some undeserved fault
ill find about the making of the bed
and here ill fling the pillow there the bolster
ay and amid this hurly i intend
that all is done in reverend care of her
and if she chance to nod ill rail and brawl
and with the clamour keep her still awake
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness
and thus ill curb her mad and headstrong humour
he that knows better how to tame a shrew
ist possible friend licio that mistress bianca
doth fancy any other but lucentio
i tell you sir she bears me fair in hand
sir to satisfy you in what i have said
stand by and mark the manner of his teaching
now mistress profit you in what you read
what master read you first resolve me that
i read that i profess the art to love
and may you prove sir master of your art
while you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart
quick proceeders marry now tell me i pray
you that durst swear at your mistress bianca
loved none in the world so well as lucentio
o despiteful love unconstant womankind
i tell thee licio this is wonderful
nor a musician as i seem to be
but one that scorn to live in this disguise
for such a one as leaves a gentleman
know sir that i am calld hortensio
signior hortensio i have often heard
of your entire affection to bianca
and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness
i will with you if you be so contented
forswear bianca and her love for ever
see how they kiss and court signior lucentio
here is my hand and here i firmly vow
never to woo her no more but do forswear her
as one unworthy all the former favours
that i have fondly flatterd her withal
and here i take the unfeigned oath
fie on her see how beastly she doth court him
would all the world but he had quite forsworn
for me that i may surely keep mine oath
i will be married to a wealthy widow
ere three days pass which hath as long loved me
as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard
and so farewell signior lucentio
kindness in women not their beauteous looks
in resolution as i swore before
mistress bianca bless you with such grace
as longeth to a lovers blessed case
nay i have taen you napping gentle love
and have forsworn you with hortensio
mistress we have
then we are rid of licio
i faith hell have a lusty widow now
that shall be wood and wedded in a day
god give him joy
ay and hell tame her
he says so tranio
faith he is gone unto the tamingschool
the tamingschool what is there such a place
ay mistress and petruchio is the master
that teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long
to tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue
o master master i have watchd so long
an ancient angel coming down the hill
will serve the turn
what is he biondello
master a mercatante or a pedant
i know not what but format in apparel
in gait and countenance surely like a father
and what of him tranio
if he be credulous and trust my tale
ill make him glad to seem vincentio
and give assurance to baptista minola
as if he were the right vincentio
take in your love and then let me alone
god save you sir
and you sir you are welcome
travel you far on or are you at the farthest
but then up farther and as for as rome
and so to tripoli if god lend me life
what countryman i pray
of mantua
of mantua sir marry god forbid
and come to padua careless of your life
my life sir how i pray for that goes hard
tis death for any one in mantua
to come to padua know you not the cause
your ships are stayd at venice and the duke
for private quarrel twixt your duke and him
tis marvel but that you are but newly come
you might have heard it else proclaimd about
alas sir it is worse for me than so
for i have bills for money by exchange
from florence and must here deliver them
well sir to do you courtesy
first tell me have you ever been at pisa
ay sir in pisa have i often been
pisa renowned for grave citizens
among them know you one vincentio
i know him not but i have heard of him
a merchant of incomparable wealth
he is my father sir and sooth to say
in countenance somewhat doth resemble you
to save your life in this extremity
this favour will i do you for his sake
and think it not the worst of an your fortunes
that you are like to sir vincentio
his name and credit shall you undertake
look that you take upon you as you should
if this be courtesy sir accept of it
o sir i do and will repute you ever
the patron of my life and liberty
then go with me to make the matter good
this by the way i let you understand
my father is here lookd for every day
to pass assurance of a dower in marriage
go with me to clothe you as becomes you
no no forsooth i dare not for my life
what did he marry me to famish me
beggars that come unto my fathers door
upon entreaty have a present aims
but i who never knew how to entreat
nor never needed that i should entreat
am starved for meat giddy for lack of sleep
and that which spites me more than all these wants
he does it under name of perfect love
as who should say if i should sleep or eat
twere deadly sickness or else present death
i prithee go and get me some repast
i care not what so it be wholesome food
what say you to a neats foot
i fear it is too choleric a meat
how say you to a fat tripe finely broild
i cannot tell i fear tis choleric
what say you to a piece of beef and mustard
a dish that i do love to feed upon
ay but the mustard is too hot a little
why then the beef and let the mustard rest
or else you get no beef of grumio
then both or one or any thing thou wilt
why then the mustard without the beef
go get thee gone thou false deluding slave
sorrow on thee and all the pack of you
that triumph thus upon my misery
go get thee gone i say
how fares my kate what sweeting all amort
mistress what cheer
faith as cold as can be
pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me
here love thou seest how diligent i am
i am sure sweet kate this kindness merits thanks
what not a word nay then thou lovest it not
and all my pains is sorted to no proof
here take away this dish
i pray you let it stand
the poorest service is repaid with thanks
and so shall mine before you touch the meat
i thank you sir
signior petruchio fie you are to blame
come mistress kate ill bear you company
here is the cap your worship did bespeak
why this was moulded on a porringer
why tis a cockle or a walnutshell
away with it come let me have a bigger
and gentlewomen wear such caps as these
when you are gentle you shall have one too
and not till then
why sir i trust i may have leave to speak
your betters have endured me say my mind
and if you cannot best you stop your ears
my tongue will tell the anger of my heart
or else my heart concealing it will break
and rather than it shall i will be free
even to the uttermost as i please in words
why thou sayst true it is a paltry cap
i love thee well in that thou likest it not
love me or love me not i like the cap
and it i will have or i will have none
o mercy god what masquing stuff is here
what up and down carved like an appletart
heres snip and nip and cut and slish and slash
why what i devils name tailor callst thou this
you bid me make it orderly and well
according to the fashion and the time
marry and did but if you be rememberd
i did not bid you mar it to the time
go hop me over every kennel home
i never saw a betterfashiond gown
belike you mean to make a puppet of me
why true he means to make a puppet of thee
she says your worship means to make
a puppet of her

because his fathers are more beautiful
or is the adder better than the eel
because his painted skin contents the eye
o no good kate neither art thou the worse
for this poor furniture and mean array
if thou accountst it shame lay it on me
to feast and sport us at thy fathers house

with one consent to have her so bestowd
for curious i cannot be with you
signior baptista of whom i hear so well

deceiving father of a deceitful son
and what of him
his daughter is to be brought by you to the supper

good lord how bright and goodly shines the moon

i know it is the sun that shines so bright
now by my mothers son and thats myself

go on and fetch our horses back again
evermore crossd and crossd nothing but crossd
say as he says or we shall never go
forward i pray since we have come so far
an if you please to call it a rushcandle
henceforth i vow it shall be so for me
i say it is the moon
i know it is the moon
but sun it is not when you say it is not
and the moon changes even as your mind
what you will have it named even that it is
and so it shall be so for katharina
petruchio go thy ways the field is won
well forward forward thus the bowl should run
and not unluckily against the bias
but soft company is coming here
tell me sweet kate and tell me truly too
hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman
such war of white and red within her cheeks
what stars do spangle heaven with such beauty
as those two eyes become that heavenly face
fair lovely maid once more good day to thee
sweet kate embrace her for her beautys sake
a will make the man mad to make a woman of him
young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet
whither away or where is thy abode

she hath prevented me here signior tranio
this bird you aimd at though you hit her not
therefore a health to all that shot and missd
o sir lucentio slippd me like his greyhound
which runs himself and catches for his master
a good swift simile but something currish
tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay
o ho petruchio tranio hits you now
i thank thee for that gird good tranio
confess confess hath he not hit you here
a has a little galld me i confess
and as the jest did glance away from me
tis ten to one it maimd you two outright
now in good sadness son petruchio
i think thou hast the veriest shrew of all
lets each one send unto his wife
and he whose wife is most obedient
to come at first when he doth send for her
shall win the wager which we will propose
content what is the wager
twenty crowns
twenty crowns
ill venture so much of my hawk or hound
but twenty times so much upon my wife
a hundred then
content
a match tis done
who shall begin
that will i
go biondello bid your mistress come to me
i go
son ill be your half bianca comes
ill have no halves ill bear it all myself
how now what news
sir my mistress sends you word
that she is busy and she cannot come
how she is busy and she cannot come
is that an answer
pray god sir your wife send you not a worse
i hope better
sirrah biondello go and entreat my wife
to come to me forthwith
o ho entreat her
nay then she must needs come
i am afraid sir
do what you can yours will not be entreated
now wheres my wife
worse and worse she will not come o vile
intolerable not to be endured
sirrah grumio go to your mistress
say i command her to come to me
i know her answer
what
she will not
the fouler fortune mine and there an end
now by my holidame here comes katharina
what is your will sir that you send for me
where is your sister and hortensios wife
they sit conferring by the parlor fire
away i say and bring them hither straight
here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder
marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life
and awful rule and right supremacy
and to be short what not thats sweet and happy
now fair befal thee good petruchio
the wager thou hast won and i will add
unto their losses twenty thousand crowns
another dowry to another daughter
for she is changed as she had never been
nay i will win my wager better yet
and show more sign of her obedience
her newbuilt virtue and obedience
see where she comes and brings your froward wives
as prisoners to her womanly persuasion
off with that bauble throw it underfoot
lord let me never have a cause to sigh
till i be brought to such a silly pass
fie what a foolish duty call you this
the wisdom of your duty fair bianca
hath cost me an hundred crowns since suppertime
the more fool you for laying on my duty
katharina i charge thee tell these headstrong women
what duty they do owe their lords and husbands
come on i say and first begin with her
she shall not
fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow
and dart not scornful glances from those eyes
it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads
confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds
and in no sense is meet or amiable
a woman moved is like a fountain troubled
muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty
and while it is so none so dry or thirsty
will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper
thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee
and for thy maintenance commits his body
to painful labour both by sea and land
to watch the night in storms the day in cold
whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe
and craves no other tribute at thy hands
but love fair looks and true obedience
too little payment for so great a debt
such duty as the subject owes the prince
even such a woman oweth to her husband
and when she is froward peevish sullen sour
and not obedient to his honest will
what is she but a foul contending rebel
and graceless traitor to her loving lord
i am ashamed that women are so simple
to offer war where they should kneel for peace
or seek for rule supremacy and sway
when they are bound to serve love and obey
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth
unapt to toil and trouble in the world
but that our soft conditions and our hearts
should well agree with our external parts
come come you froward and unable worms
my mind hath been as big as one of yours
my heart as great my reason haply more
to bandy word for word and frown for frown
but now i see our lances are but straws
our strength as weak our weakness past compare
that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
then vail your stomachs for it is no boot
in token of which duty if he please
my hand is ready may it do him ease
why theres a wench come on and kiss me kate
well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt hat
tis a good hearing when children are toward
but a harsh hearing when women are froward
come kate well to bed
we three are married but you two are sped
twas i won the wager though you hit the white
and being a winner god give you good night
now go thy ways thou hast tamed a curst shrew
tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamed so
boatswain
heigh my hearts cheerly cheerly my hearts
yare yare take in the topsail tend to the
masters whistle blow till thou burst thy wind
if room enough
good boatswain have care wheres the master
play the men
i pray now keep below
where is the master boatswain
nay good be patient
when the sea is hence what cares these roarers
good yet remember whom thou hast aboard
none that i more love than myself you are a
counsellor if you can command these elements to
silence and work the peace of the present we will
cannot give thanks you have lived so long and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour if it so hap cheerly good hearts out
of our way i say
hath no drowning mark upon him his complexion is
perfect gallows stand fast good fate to his
for our own doth little advantage if he be not
born to be hanged our case is miserable
down with the topmast yare lower lower bring
her to try with maincourse
a plague upon this howling they are louder than
the weather or our office
yet again what do you here shall we give oer
and drown have you a mind to sink
a pox o your throat you bawling blasphemous
incharitable dog
work you then
hang cur hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker
we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art
ill warrant him for drowning though the ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench
lay her ahold ahold set her two courses off to
sea again lay her off
all lost to prayers to prayers all lost
what must our mouths be cold
the king and prince at prayers lets assist them
for our case is as theirs
im out of patience
this widechappd rascalwould thou mightst lie drowning
the washing of ten tides
hell be hangd yet
though every drop of water swear against it
and gape at widest to glut him
lets all sink with the king
lets take leave of him
now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
acre of barren ground long heath brown furze any
thing the wills above be done but i would fain
die a dry death
if by your art my dearest father you have
put the wild waters in this roar allay them
the sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch
but that the sea mounting to the welkins cheek
dashes the fire out o i have suffered
who had no doubt some noble creature in her
dashd all to pieces o the cry did knock
against my very heart poor souls they perishd
had i been any god of power i would
have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
it should the good ship so have swallowd and
the fraughting souls within her
theres no harm done
o woe the day
no harm
i have done nothing but in care of thee
of thee my dear one thee my daughter who
art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing
of whence i am nor that i am more better
than prospero master of a full poor cell
and thy no greater father
more to know
did never meddle with my thoughts
tis time
i should inform thee farther lend thy hand
lie there my art wipe thou thine eyes have comfort
the direful spectacle of the wreck which touchd
the very virtue of compassion in thee
i have with such provision in mine art
so safely ordered that there is no soul
no not so much perdition as an hair
betid to any creature in the vessel
which thou heardst cry which thou sawst sink sit down
for thou must now know farther
you have often
begun to tell me what i am but stoppd
and left me to a bootless inquisition
the hours now come
the very minute bids thee ope thine ear
obey and be attentive canst thou remember
a time before we came unto this cell
i do not think thou canst for then thou wast not
out three years old
certainly sir i can
by what by any other house or person
of any thing the image tell me that
hath kept with thy remembrance
tis far off
and rather like a dream than an assurance
that my remembrance warrants had i not
four or five women once that tended me
thou hadst and more miranda but how is it
that this lives in thy mind what seest thou else
in the dark backward and abysm of time
if thou rememberst aught ere thou camest here
how thou camest here thou mayst
but that i do not
twelve year since miranda twelve year since
thy father was the duke of milan and
a prince of power
sir are not you my father
thy mother was a piece of virtue and
she said thou wast my daughter and thy father
was duke of milan and thou his only heir
and princess no worse issued
o the heavens
what foul play had we that we came from thence
or blessed wast we did
by foul play as thou sayst were we heaved thence
but blessedly holp hither
o my heart bleeds
to think o the teen that i have turnd you to
which is from my remembrance please you farther
my brother and thy uncle calld antonio
i pray thee mark methat a brother should
be so perfidioushe whom next thyself
of all the world i loved and to him put
the manage of my state as at that time
through all the signories it was the first
and prospero the prime duke being so reputed
in dignity and for the liberal arts
without a parallel those being all my study
the government i cast upon my brother
and to my state grew stranger being transported
and rapt in secret studies thy false uncle
dost thou attend me
sir most heedfully
being once perfected how to grant suits
how to deny them who to advance and who
to trash for overtopping new created
the creatures that were mine i say or changed em
or else new formd em having both the key
of officer and office set all hearts i the state
to what tune pleased his ear that now he was
the ivy which had hid my princely trunk
and suckd my verdure out ont thou attendst not
o good sir i do
i pray thee mark me
i thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated
to closeness and the bettering of my mind
with that which but by being so retired
oerprized all popular rate in my false brother
awaked an evil nature and my trust
like a good parent did beget of him
a falsehood in its contrary as great
as my trust was which had indeed no limit
a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded
not only with what my revenue yielded
but what my power might else exact like one
who having into truth by telling of it
made such a sinner of his memory
to credit his own lie he did believe
he was indeed the duke out o the substitution
and executing the outward face of royalty
dost thou hear
your tale sir would cure deafness
to have no screen between this part he playd
and him he playd it for he needs will be
absolute milan me poor man my library
he thinks me now incapable confederates
so dry he was for swaywi the king of naples
to give him annual tribute do him homage
subject his coronet to his crown and bend
the dukedom yet unbowdalas poor milan
to most ignoble stooping
o the heavens
mark his condition and the event then tell me
if this might be a brother
i should sin
good wombs have borne bad sons
now the condition
the king of naples being an enemy
to me inveterate hearkens my brothers suit
which was that he in lieu o the premises
of homage and i know not how much tribute
should presently extirpate me and mine
out of the dukedom and confer fair milan
a treacherous army levied one midnight
fated to the purpose did antonio open
the gates of milan and i the dead of darkness
the ministers for the purpose hurried thence
me and thy crying self
alack for pity
i not remembering how i cried out then
that wrings mine eyes tot
hear a little further
and then ill bring thee to the present business
which nows upons without the which this story
were most impertinent
wherefore did they not
that hour destroy us
my tale provokes that question dear they durst not
so dear the love my people bore me nor set
a mark so bloody on the business but
with colours fairer painted their foul ends
in few they hurried us aboard a bark
bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared
a rotten carcass of a boat not riggd
nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats
to cry to the sea that roard to us to sigh
to the winds whose pity sighing back again
did us but loving wrong
alack what trouble
was i then to you
o a cherubim
thou wast that did preserve me thou didst smile
infused with a fortitude from heaven
when i have deckd the sea with drops full salt
under my burthen groand which raised in me
an undergoing stomach to bear up
against what should ensue
how came we ashore
by providence divine
some food we had and some fresh water that
a noble neapolitan gonzalo
out of his charity being then appointed
master of this design did give us with
rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries
which since have steaded much so of his gentleness
knowing i loved my books he furnishd me
from mine own library with volumes that
i prize above my dukedom
would i might
but ever see that man
sit still and hear the last of our seasorrow
here in this island we arrived and here
have i thy schoolmaster made thee more profit
than other princesses can that have more time
for vainer hours and tutors not so careful
heavens thank you fort and now i pray you sir
for still tis beating in my mind your reason
for raising this seastorm
know thus far forth
by accident most strange bountiful fortune
now my dear lady hath mine enemies
brought to this shore and by my prescience
i find my zenith doth depend upon
a most auspicious star whose influence
if now i court not but omit my fortunes
thou art inclined to sleep tis a good dulness
come away servant come i am ready now
approach my ariel come
all hail great master grave sir hail i come
to answer thy best pleasure bet to fly
to swim to dive into the fire to ride
on the curld clouds to thy strong bidding task
ariel and all his quality
hast thou spirit
performd to point the tempest that i bade thee
to every article
i boarded the kings ship now on the beak
now in the waist the deck in every cabin
and burn in many places on the topmast
the yards and bowsprit would i flame distinctly
then meet and join joves lightnings the precursors
o the dreadful thunderclaps more momentary
and sightoutrunning were not the fire and cracks
of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune
seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble
yea his dread trident shake
my brave spirit
who was so firm so constant that this coil
would not infect his reason
not a soul
but felt a fever of the mad and playd
some tricks of desperation all but mariners
plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel
with hair upstaringthen like reeds not hair
was the first man that leapd cried hell is empty
and all the devils are here
why thats my spirit
but was not this nigh shore
close by my master
but are they ariel safe
not a hair perishd
on their sustaining garments not a blemish
in troops i have dispersed them bout the isle
the kings son have i landed by himself
whom i left cooling of the air with sighs
in an odd angle of the isle and sitting
his arms in this sad knot
of the kings ship
the mariners say how thou hast disposed
and all the rest o the fleet
safely in harbour
is the kings ship in the deep nook where once
thou calldst me up at midnight to fetch dew
the mariners all under hatches stowd
who with a charm joind to their sufferd labour
i have left asleep and for the rest o the fleet
which i dispersed they all have met again
and are upon the mediterranean flote
bound sadly home for naples
supposing that they saw the kings ship wreckd
and his great person perish
ariel thy charge
what is the time o the day
past the mid season
at least two glasses the time twixt six and now
must by us both be spent most preciously
is there more toil since thou dost give me pains
let me remember thee what thou hast promised
which is not yet performd me
how now moody
what ist thou canst demand
my liberty
before the time be out no more
i prithee
remember i have done thee worthy service
told thee no lies made thee no mistakings served
to bate me a full year
dost thou forget
from what a torment i did free thee
no
thou dost and thinkst it much to tread the ooze
of the salt deep
to run upon the sharp wind of the north
to do me business in the veins o the earth
when it is baked with frost
i do not sir
thou liest malignant thing hast thou forgot
the foul witch sycorax who with age and envy
was grown into a hoop hast thou forgot her
no sir
thou hast where was she born speak tell me
sir in argier
o was she so i must
once in a month recount what thou hast been
which thou forgetst this damnd witch sycorax
for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
to enter human hearing from argier
they would not take her life is not this true
ay sir
this blueeyed hag was hither brought with child
and here was left by the sailors thou my slave
as thou reportst thyself wast then her servant
and for thou wast a spirit too delicate
to act her earthy and abhorrd commands
refusing her grand hests she did confine thee
by help of her more potent ministers
and in her most unmitigable rage
into a cloven pine within which rift
imprisond thou didst painfully remain
a dozen years within which space she died
and left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans
as fast as millwheels strike then was this island
save for the son that she did litter here
a freckled whelp hagbornnot honourd with
a human shape
yes caliban her son
dull thing i say so he that caliban
whom now i keep in service thou best knowst
what torment i did find thee in thy groans
did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
to lay upon the damnd which sycorax
when i arrived and heard thee that made gape
the pine and let thee out
i thank thee master
if thou more murmurst i will rend an oak
and peg thee in his knotty entrails till
thou hast howld away twelve winters
pardon master
i will be correspondent to command
and do my spiriting gently
do so and after two days
i will discharge thee
thats my noble master
what shall i do say what what shall i do
to no sight but thine and mine invisible
to every eyeball else go take this shape
awake dear heart awake thou hast slept well awake
the strangeness of your story put
heaviness in me
shake it off come on
well visit caliban my slave who never
yields us kind answer
tis a villain sir
i do not love to look on
but as tis
fetch in our wood and serves in offices
that profit us what ho slave caliban
thou earth thou speak
come thou tortoise when
fine apparition my quaint ariel
hark in thine ear
my lord it shall be done
thou poisonous slave got by the devil himself
upon thy wicked dam come forth
as wicked dew as eer my mother brushd
with ravens feather from unwholesome fen
drop on you both a southwest blow on ye
and blister you all oer
for this be sure tonight thou shalt have cramps
sidestitches that shall pen thy breath up urchins
shall for that vast of night that they may work
all exercise on thee thou shalt be pinchd
as thick as honeycomb each pinch more stinging
than bees that made em
i must eat my dinner
this islands mine by sycorax my mother
which thou takest from me when thou camest first
thou strokedst me and madest much of me wouldst give me
water with berries int and teach me how
to name the bigger light and how the less
and showd thee all the qualities o the isle
cursed be i that did so all the charms
of sycorax toads beetles bats light on you
for i am all the subjects that you have
in this hard rock whiles you do keep from me
the rest o the island
thou most lying slave
whom stripes may move not kindness i have used thee
filth as thou art with human care and lodged thee
in mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate
the honour of my child
o ho o ho wouldt had been done
thou didst prevent me i had peopled else
this isle with calibans
abhorred slave
which any print of goodness wilt not take
being capable of all ill i pitied thee
took pains to make thee speak taught thee each hour
know thine own meaning but wouldst gabble like
a thing most brutish i endowd thy purposes
with words that made them known but thy vile race
though thou didst learn had that int which
good natures
could not abide to be with therefore wast thou
deservedly confined into this rock
who hadst deserved more than a prison
you taught me language and my profit ont
is i know how to curse the red plague rid you
for learning me your language
hagseed hence
fetch us in fuel and be quick thourt best
to answer other business shrugst thou malice
if thou neglectst or dost unwillingly
what i command ill rack thee with old cramps
fill all thy bones with aches make thee roar
that beasts shall tremble at thy din
no pray thee
it would control my dams god setebos
and make a vassal of him
so slave hence
come unto these yellow sands
courtsied when you have and kissd
the wild waves whist
foot it featly here and there
and sweet sprites the burthen bear
hark hark
where should this music be i the air or the earth
some god o the island sitting on a bank
weeping again the king my fathers wreck
this music crept by me upon the waters
allaying both their fury and my passion
or it hath drawn me rather but tis gone
no it begins again
full fathom five thy father lies
of his bones are coral made
nothing of him that doth fade
but doth suffer a seachange
into something rich and strange
seanymphs hourly ring his knell
hark now i hear themdingdong bell
the ditty does remember my drownd father
this is no mortal business nor no sound
that the earth owes i hear it now above me
the fringed curtains of thine eye advance
and say what thou seest yond
what ist a spirit
lord how it looks about believe me sir
it carries a brave form but tis a spirit
no wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
as we have such this gallant which thou seest
was in the wreck and but hes something staind
with grief thats beautys canker thou mightst call him
and strays about to find em
i might call him
a thing divine for nothing natural
i ever saw so noble
most sure the goddess
on whom these airs attend vouchsafe my prayer
may know if you remain upon this island
and that you will some good instruction give
which i do last pronounce is o you wonder
if you be maid or no
no wonder sir
but certainly a maid
my language heavens
i am the best of them that speak this speech
were i but where tis spoken
how the best
what wert thou if the king of naples heard thee
a single thing as i am now that wonders
to hear thee speak of naples he does hear me
who with mine eyes never since at ebb beheld
the king my father wreckd
alack for mercy
yes faith and all his lords the duke of milan
and his brave son being twain
why speaks my father so ungently this
is the third man that eer i saw the first
to be inclined my way
o if a virgin
and your affection not gone forth ill make you
the queen of naples
soft sir one word more
they are both in eithers powers but this swift business
i must uneasy make lest too light winning
make the prize light
one word more i charge thee
the name thou owest not and hast put thyself
upon this island as a spy to win it
from me the lord ont
no as i am a man
if the ill spirit have so fair a house
good things will strive to dwell witht
follow me
speak not you for him hes a traitor come
seawater shalt thou drink thy food shall be
the freshbrook muscles witherd roots and husks
wherein the acorn cradled follow
no
i will resist such entertainment till
mine enemy has more power
o dear father
make not too rash a trial of him for
hes gentle and not fearful
what i say
my foot my tutor put thy sword up traitor
who makest a show but darest not strike thy conscience
for i can here disarm thee with this stick
and make thy weapon drop
beseech you father
hence hang not on my garments
sir have pity
ill be his surety
silence one word more
shall make me chide thee if not hate thee what
an advocate for an imposter hush
thou thinkst there is no more such shapes as he
to the most of men this is a caliban
and they to him are angels
my affections
are then most humble i have no ambition
to see a goodlier man
thy nerves are in their infancy again
and have no vigour in them
so they are
my spirits as in a dream are all bound up
my fathers loss the weakness which i feel
the wreck of all my friends nor this mans threats
to whom i am subdued are but light to me
might i but through my prison once a day
let liberty make use of space enough
have i in such a prison
be of comfort
my fathers of a better nature sir
which now came from him
thou shalt be free
all points of my command
to the syllable
come follow speak not for him
beseech you sir be merry you have cause
so have we all of joy for our escape
is much beyond our loss our hint of woe
is common every day some sailors wife
the masters of some merchant and the merchant
have just our theme of woe but for the miracle
i mean our preservation few in millions
our sorrow with our comfort
prithee peace
he receives comfort like cold porridge
the visitor will not give him oer so
look hes winding up the watch of his wit
by and by it will strike
sir
when every grief is entertaind thats offerd
comes to the entertainer
a dollar
have spoken truer than you purposed
you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should
therefore my lord
fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue
i prithee spare
he will be talking
which of he or adrian for a good
wager first begins to crow
the old cock
the cockerel
done the wager
a laughter
a match
though this island seem to be desert
ha ha ha so youre paid
uninhabitable and almost inaccessible
yet
yet
he could not misst
it must needs be of subtle tender and delicate
temperance
temperance was a delicate wench
ay and a subtle as he most learnedly delivered
the air breathes upon us here most sweetly
as if it had lungs and rotten ones
or as twere perfumed by a fen
here is everything advantageous to life
true save means to live
of that theres none or little
how lush and lusty the grass looks how green
the ground indeed is tawny
with an eye of green int
he misses not much
no he doth but mistake the truth totally
but the rarity of it iswhich is indeed almost
beyond credit
as many vouched rarities are
that our garments being as they were drenched in
the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses being rather newdyed than stained with
salt water
if but one of his pockets could speak would it not
say he lies
ay or very falsely pocket up his report
methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
put them on first in afric at the marriage of
the kings fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis
twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return
tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
their queen
not since widow didos time
widow a pox o that how came that widow in
widow dido
what if he had said widower aeneas too good lord
how you take it
she was of carthage not of tunis
this tunis sir was carthage
carthage
i assure you carthage
his word is more than the miraculous harp he hath
raised the wall and houses too
what impossible matter will he make easy next
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket
and give it his son for an apple
and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring
forth more islands
ay
why in good time
sir we were talking that our garments seem now
as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage
of your daughter who is now queen
and the rarest that eer came there
bate i beseech you widow dido
o widow dido ay widow dido
is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day i
wore it i mean in a sort
that sort was well fished for
when i wore it at your daughters marriage
you cram these words into mine ears against
the stomach of my sense would i had never
married my daughter there for coming thence
my son is lost and in my rate she too
who is so far from italy removed
i neer again shall see her o thou mine heir
of naples and of milan what strange fish
hath made his meal on thee
i saw him beat the surges under him
and ride upon their backs he trod the water
whose enmity he flung aside and breasted
the surge most swoln that met him his bold head
bove the contentious waves he kept and oard
himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
to the shore that oer his waveworn basis bowd
he came alive to land
no no hes gone
sir you may thank yourself for this great loss
that would not bless our europe with your daughter
but rather lose her to an african
where she at least is banishd from your eye
who hath cause to wet the grief ont
prithee peace
you were kneeld to and importuned otherwise
by all of us and the fair soul herself
weighd between loathness and obedience at
which end o the beam should bow we have lost your
son
more widows in them of this business making
the faults your own
so is the dearst o the loss
my lord sebastian
the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
when you should bring the plaster
very well
and most chirurgeonly
it is foul weather in us all good sir
when you are cloudy
foul weather
very foul
had i plantation of this isle my lord
held sowt with nettleseed
or docks or mallows
and were the king ont what would i do
scape being drunk for want of wine
i the commonwealth i would by contraries
execute all things for no kind of traffic
would i admit no name of magistrate
letters should not be known riches poverty
and use of service none contract succession
bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none
no use of metal corn or wine or oil
no occupation all men idle all
and women too but innocent and pure
no sovereignty
yet he would be king ont
the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
beginning
all things in common nature should produce
sword pike knife gun or need of any engine
would i not have but nature should bring forth
of its own kind all foison all abundance
to feed my innocent people
no marrying mong his subjects
i would with such perfection govern sir
to excel the golden age
god save his majesty
long live gonzalo
anddo you mark me sir
i do well believe your highness and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing
twas you we laughed at
who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
nothing still
what a blow was there given
an it had not fallen flatlong
you are gentlemen of brave metal you would lift
the moon out of her sphere if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing
we would so and then go a batfowling
nay good my lord be not angry
no i warrant you i will not adventure
my discretion so weakly will you laugh
me asleep for i am very heavy
go sleep and hear us
what all so soon asleep i wish mine eyes
they are inclined to do so
please you sir
it seldom visits sorrow when it doth
it is a comforter
we two my lord
will guard your person while you take your rest
and watch your safety
thank you wondrous heavy
what a strange drowsiness possesses them
it is the quality o the climate
why
doth it not then our eyelids sink i find not
myself disposed to sleep
nor i my spirits are nimble
they fell together all as by consent
they droppd as by a thunderstroke what might
and yet me thinks i see it in thy face
my strong imagination sees a crown
dropping upon thy head
what art thou waking
do you not hear me speak
i do and surely
it is a sleepy language and thou speakst
out of thy sleep what is it thou didst say
this is a strange repose to be asleep
with eyes wide open standing speaking moving
and yet so fast asleep
noble sebastian
thou letst thy fortune sleepdie rather winkst
whiles thou art waking
