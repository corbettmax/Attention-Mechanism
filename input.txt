before we proceed any further hear me speak
speak speak
you are all resolved rather to die than to famish
resolved resolved
first you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people
we knowt we knowt
let us kill him and well have corn at our own price
ist a verdict
one word good citizens
we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good
would yield us but the superfluity while it were
wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely
afflicts us the object of our misery is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance our
sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with
speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge
would you proceed especially against caius marcius
consider you what services he has done for his country
very well and could be content to give him good
report fort but that he pays himself with being proud
nay but speak not maliciously
i say unto you what he hath done famously he did
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud which he
is even till the altitude of his virtue
what he cannot help in his nature you account a
vice in him you must in no way say he is covetous
if i must not i need not be barren of accusations
he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition
what shouts are these the other side o the city
come come
soft who comes here
worthy menenius agrippa one that hath always loved
the people
what works my countrymen in hand where go you
with bats and clubs the matter speak i pray you
our business is not unknown to the senate they have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do
which now well show em in deeds they say poor
have strong arms too
why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours
will you undo yourselves
we cannot sir we are undone already
i tell you friends most charitable care
have the patricians of you for your wants
your suffering in this dearth you may as well
strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
against the roman state whose course will on
the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs
of more strong link asunder than can ever
appear in your impediment for the dearth
the gods not the patricians make it and
your knees to them not arms must help alack
you are transported by calamity
thither where more attends you and you slander
the helms o the state who care for you like fathers
when you curse them as enemies
care for us true indeed they neer cared for us
crammed with grain make edicts for usury to
support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich and provide more
piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain
the poor if the wars eat us not up they will and
theres all the love they bear us
either you must
confess yourselves wondrous malicious
or be accused of folly i shall tell you
but since it serves my purpose i will venture
to stale t a little more
you deliver
there was a time when all the bodys members
that only like a gulf it did remain
i the midst o the body idle and unactive
still cupboarding the viand never bearing
like labour with the rest where the other instruments
did see and hear devise instruct walk feel
and mutually participate did minister
unto the appetite and affection common
of the whole body the belly answerd
well sir what answer made the belly
sir i shall tell you with a kind of smile
which neer came from the lungs but even thus
for look you i may make the belly smile
as well as speakit tauntingly replied
to the discontented members the mutinous parts
that envied his receipt even so most fitly
as you malign our senators for that
they are not such as you
your bellys answer what
the kinglycrowned head the vigilant eye
the counsellor heart the arm our soldier
our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter
with other muniments and petty helps
in this our fabric if that they
what then
fore me this fellow speaks what then what then
should by the cormorant belly be restraind
who is the sink o the body
well what then
the former agents if they did complain
what could the belly answer
i will tell you
if youll bestow a smallof what you have little
patience awhile youll hear the bellys answer
yere long about it
note me this good friend
your most grave belly was deliberate
true is it my incorporate friends quoth he
that i receive the general food at first
which you do live upon and fit it is
because i am the storehouse and the shop
i send it through the rivers of your blood
even to the court the heart to the seat o the brain
and through the cranks and offices of man
the strongest nerves and small inferior veins
from me receive that natural competency
you my good friendsthis says the belly mark me
ay sir well well
though all at once cannot
see what i do deliver out to each
yet i can make my audit up that all
from me do back receive the flour of all
and leave me but the bran what say you tot
the senators of rome are this good belly
and you the mutinous members for examine
their counsels and their cares digest things rightly
touching the weal o the common you shall find
no public benefit which you receive
but it proceeds or comes from them to you
and no way from yourselves what do you think
you the great toe of this assembly
i the great toe why the great toe
for that being one o the lowest basest poorest
thou rascal that art worst in blood to run
leadst first to win some vantage
rome and her rats are at the point of battle
the one side must have bale
hail noble marcius
thanks whats the matter you dissentious rogues
that rubbing the poor itch of your opinion
make yourselves scabs
we have ever your good word
he that will give good words to thee will flatter
beneath abhorring what would you have you curs
that like nor peace nor war the one affrights you
the other makes you proud he that trusts to you
where he should find you lions finds you hares
than is the coal of fire upon the ice
or hailstone in the sun your virtue is
to make him worthy whose offence subdues him
and curse that justice did it
who deserves greatness
deserves your hate and your affections are
a sick mans appetite who desires most that
which would increase his evil he that depends
upon your favours swims with fins of lead
and hews down oaks with rushes hang ye trust ye
with every minute you do change a mind
and call him noble that was now your hate
him vile that was your garland whats the matter
that in these several places of the city
you cry against the noble senate who
under the gods keep you in awe which else
would feed on one another whats their seeking
for corn at their own rates whereof they say
the city is well stored
hang em they say
theyll sit by the fire and presume to know
whats done i the capitol whos like to rise
who thrives and who declines side factions
and give out
conjectural marriages making parties strong
and feebling such as stand not in their liking
below their cobbled shoes they say theres
grain enough
would the nobility lay aside their ruth
and let me use my sword ill make a quarry
with thousands of these quarterd slaves as high
as i could pick my lance
nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded
for though abundantly they lack discretion
yet are they passing cowardly but i beseech you
what says the other troop
they said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs
that hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat
that meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not
they vented their complainings which being answerd
and a petition granted them a strange one
to break the heart of generosity
and make bold power look palethey threw their caps
as they would hang them on the horns o the moon
shouting their emulation
what is granted them
five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms
sicinius velutus and i know notsdeath
the rabble should have first unroofd the city
win upon power and throw forth greater themes
for insurrections arguing
this is strange
go get you home you fragments
wheres caius marcius
the news is sir the volsces are in arms
our musty superfluity see our best elders
marcius tis true that you have lately told us
the volsces are in arms
they have a leader
tullus aufidius that will put you to t
i sin in envying his nobility
and were i any thing but what i am
i would wish me only he
you have fought together
were half to half the world by the ears and he
upon my party ild revolt to make
that i am proud to hunt
then worthy marcius
attend upon cominius to these wars
it is your former promise
sir it is
and i am constant titus lartius thou
shalt see me once more strike at tullus face
what art thou stiff standst out
no caius marcius
ill lean upon one crutch and fight with tother
ere stay behind this business
o truebred
your company to the capitol where i know
our greatest friends attend us
noble marcius
the volsces have much corn take these rats thither
to gnaw their garners worshipful mutiners
was ever man so proud as is this marcius
he has no equal
when we were chosen tribunes for the people
markd you his lip and eyes
nay but his taunts
being moved he will not spare to gird the gods
bemock the modest moon
too proud to be so valiant
such a nature
tickled with good success disdains the shadow
his insolence can brook to be commanded
under cominius
fame at the which he aims
in whom already hes well graced can not
better be held nor more attaind than by
shall be the generals fault though he perform
to the utmost of a man and giddy censure
will then cry out of marcius o if he
had borne the business
besides if things go well
opinion that so sticks on marcius shall
of his demerits rob cominius
half all cominius honours are to marcius
though marcius earned them not and all his faults
to marcius shall be honours though indeed
in aught he merit not
lets hence and hear
how the dispatch is made and in what fashion
more than his singularity he goes
upon this present action
lets along
so your opinion is aufidius
that they of rome are entered in our counsels
and know how we proceed
is it not yours
what ever have been thought on in this state
that could be brought to bodily act ere rome
had circumvention tis not four days gone
i have the letter here yes here it is
they have pressd a power but it is not known
the people mutinous and it is rumourd
cominius marcius your old enemy
who is of rome worse hated than of you
and titus lartius a most valiant roman
these three lead on this preparation
consider of it
our armys in the field
we never yet made doubt but rome was ready
to answer us
nor did you think it folly
to keep your great pretences veild till when
they needs must show themselves which
in the hatching
it seemd appeard to rome by the discovery
we shall be shortend in our aim which was
to take in many towns ere almost rome
should know we were afoot
noble aufidius
if they set down before s for the remove
bring your army but i think youll find
theyve not prepared for us
o doubt not that
i speak from certainties nay more
some parcels of their power are forth already
and only hitherward i leave your honours
if we and caius marcius chance to meet
tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
till one can do no more
the gods assist you
and keep your honours safe
farewell
farewell
farewell
i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love when yet he was but
tenderbodied and the only son of my womb when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way when
for a day of kings entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding i considering
how honour would become such a person that it was
no better than picturelike to hang by the wall if
renown made it not stir was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame to a cruel
war i sent him from whence he returned his brows
bound with oak i tell thee daughter i sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a manchild
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man
but had he died in the business madam how then
then his good report should have been my son i
therein would have found issue hear me profess
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
marcius i had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action
madam the lady valeria is come to visit you
beseech you give me leave to retire myself
indeed you shall not
methinks i hear hither your husbands drum
see him pluck aufidius down by the hair
come on you cowards you were got in fear
with his maild hand then wiping forth he goes
like to a harvestman thats taskd to mow
or all or lose his hire
his bloody brow o jupiter no blood
away you fool it more becomes a man
when she did suckle hector lookd not lovelier
than hectors forehead when it spit forth blood
at grecian sword contemning tell valeria
we are fit to bid her welcome
heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius
hell beat aufidius head below his knee
and tread upon his neck
my ladies both good day to you
sweet madam
i am glad to see your ladyship
how do you both you are manifest housekeepers
what are you sewing here a fine spot in good
faith how does your little son
i thank your ladyship well good madam
he had rather see the swords and hear a drum than
look upon his schoolmaster
very pretty boy o my troth i looked upon him o
confirmed countenance i saw him run after a gilded
again and after it again and over and over he
comes and again catched it again or whether his
fall enraged him or how twas he did so set his
teeth and tear it o i warrant it how he mammocked
it
one on s fathers moods

threshold till my lord return from the wars

my prayers but i cannot go thither

down before their city corioli they nothing doubt

on mine honour and so i pray go with us

yonder comes news a wager they have met
my horse to yours no
tis done
agreed
say has our general met the enemy
they lie in view but have not spoke as yet
so the good horse is mine
ill buy him of you
for half a hundred years summon the town
how far off lie these armies
within this mile and half
then shall we hear their larum and they ours
now mars i prithee make us quick in work
that we with smoking swords may march from hence
to help our fielded friends come blow thy blast
tutus aufidius is he within your walls
no nor a man that fears you less than he
thats lesser than a little
hark our drums
are bringing forth our youth well break our walls
which yet seem shut we have but pinnd with rushes
theyll open of themselves
hark you far off
there is aufidius list what work he makes
amongst your cloven army
o they are at it
their noise be our instruction ladders ho
they fear us not but issue forth their city
now put your shields before your hearts and fight
with hearts more proof than shields advance
they do disdain us much beyond our thoughts
he that retires ill take him for a volsce
and he shall feel mine edge
all the contagion of the south light on you
you shames of rome you herd ofboils and plagues
plaster you oer that you may be abhorrd
further than seen and one infect another
against the wind a mile you souls of geese
that bear the shapes of men how have you run
from slaves that apes would beat pluto and hell
all hurt behind backs red and faces pale
with flight and agued fear mend and charge home
or by the fires of heaven ill leave the foe
if youll stand fast well beat them to their wives
as they us to our trenches followed
tis for the followers fortune widens them
foolhardiness not i
nor i
see they have shut him in
to the pot i warrant him
what is become of marcius
slain sir doubtless
following the fliers at the very heels
with them he enters who upon the sudden
to answer all the city
o noble fellow
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword
a carbuncle entire as big as thou art
were not so rich a jewel thou wast a soldier
even to catos wish not fierce and terrible
only in strokes but with thy grim looks and
the thunderlike percussion of thy sounds
thou madst thine enemies shake as if the world
were feverous and did tremble
look sir
otis marcius
lets fetch him off or make remain alike
this will i carry to rome
and i this
a murrain ont i took this for silver
see here these movers that do prize their hours
at a crackd drachm cushions leaden spoons
irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would
bury with those that wore them these base slaves
and hark what noise the general makes to him
there is the man of my souls hate aufidius
convenient numbers to make good the city
whilst i with those that have the spirit will haste
to help cominius
worthy sir thou bleedst
thy exercise hath been too violent for
a second course of fight
sir praise me not
the blood i drop is rather physical
i will appear and fight
now the fair goddess fortune
fall deep in love with thee and her great charms
misguide thy opposers swords bold gentleman
prosperity be thy page
thy friend no less
than those she placeth highest so farewell
thou worthiest marcius
go sound thy trumpet in the marketplace
call thither all the officers o the town
we are come off
like romans neither foolish in our stands
we shall be charged again whiles we have struck
by interims and conveying gusts we have heard
the charges of our friends ye roman gods
lead their successes as we wish our own
that both our powers with smiling
fronts encountering
may give you thankful sacrifice
thy news
the citizens of corioli have issued
i saw our party to their trenches driven
and then i came away
though thou speakst truth
methinks thou speakst not well
how long ist since
above an hour my lord
how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour
and bring thy news so late
spies of the volsces
held me in chase that i was forced to wheel
three or four miles about else had i sir
half an hour since brought my report
whos yonder
that does appear as he were flayd o gods
he has the stamp of marcius and i have
beforetime seen him thus
the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
more than i know the sound of marcius tongue
from every meaner man
come i too late
ay if you come not in the blood of others
but mantled in your own
o let me clip ye
in arms as sound as when i wood in heart
as merry as when our nuptial day was done
and tapers burnd to bedward
flower of warriors
how is it with titus lartius
condemning some to death and some to exile
ransoming him or pitying threatening the other
holding corioli in the name of rome
even like a fawning greyhound in the leash
to let him slip at will
where is that slave
which told me they had beat you to your trenches
where is he call him hither
let him alone
the common filea plague tribunes for them
the mouse neer shunnd the cat as they did budge
from rascals worse than they
but how prevaild you
will the time serve to tell i do not think
where is the enemy are you lords o the field
if not why cease you till you are so
marcius
we have at disadvantage fought and did
retire to win our purpose
how lies their battle know you on which side
they have placed their men of trust
as i guess marcius
their bands i the vaward are the antiates
of their best trust oer them aufidius
their very heart of hope
i do beseech you
by all the battles wherein we have fought
by the blood we have shed together by the vows
we have made to endure friends that you directly
set me against aufidius and his antiates
and that you not delay the present but
filling the air with swords advanced and darts
we prove this very hour
though i could wish
you were conducted to a gentle bath
and balms applied to you yet dare i never
that best can aid your action
those are they
that most are willing if any such be here
as it were sin to doubtthat love this painting
wherein you see me smeard if any fear
lesser his person than an ill report
if any think brave death outweighs bad life
and that his countrys dearer than himself
let him alone or so many so minded
wave thus to express his disposition
and follow marcius
o me alone make you a sword of me
if these shows be not outward which of you
but is four volsces none of you but is
able to bear against the great aufidius
a shield as hard as his a certain number
though thanks to all must i select
shall bear the business in some other fight
as cause will be obeyd please you to march
and four shall quickly draw out my command
which men are best inclined
make good this ostentation and you shall
divide in all with us
as i have set them down if i do send dispatch
we cannot keep the town
fear not our care sir
hence and shut your gates upons
our guider come to the roman camp conduct us
ill fight with none but thee for i do hate thee
worse than a promisebreaker
not afric owns a serpent i abhor
more than thy fame and envy fix thy foot
let the first budger die the others slave
and the gods doom him after
if i fly marcius
holloa me like a hare
within these three hours tullus
alone i fought in your corioli walls
wherein thou seest me maskd for thy revenge
wrench up thy power to the highest
wert thou the hector
that was the whip of your braggd progeny
thou shouldst not scape me here
officious and not valiant you have shamed me
in your condemned seconds
if i should tell thee oer this thy days work
where senators shall mingle tears with smiles
where great patricians shall attend and shrug
i the end admire where ladies shall be frighted
and gladly quaked hear more where the
dull tribunes
that with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours
shall say against their hearts we thank the gods
our rome hath such a soldier
yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast
having fully dined before
o general
hadst thou beheld
who has a charter to extol her blood
when she does praise me grieves me i have done
as you have done thats what i can induced
he that has but effected his good will
hath overtaen mine act
you shall not be
the grave of your deserving rome must know
worse than a theft no less than a traducement
to hide your doings and to silence that
which to the spire and top of praises vouchd
in sign of what you are not to reward
what you have donebefore our army hear me
i have some wounds upon me and they smart
to hear themselves rememberd
should they not
well might they fester gainst ingratitude
and tent themselves with death of all the horses
whereof we have taen good and good store of all
the treasure in this field achieved and city
we render you the tenth to be taen forth
before the common distribution at
your only choice
i thank you general
but cannot make my heart consent to take
and stand upon my common part with those
that have beheld the doing
may these same instruments which you profane
never sound more when drums and trumpets shall
i the field prove flatterers let courts and cities be
made all of falsefaced soothing
when steel grows soft as the parasites silk
let him be made a coverture for the wars
no more i say for that i have not washd
my nose that bled or foild some debile wretch
which without note heres many else have done
you shout me forth
in acclamations hyperbolical
as if i loved my little should be dieted
in praises sauced with lies
too modest are you
more cruel to your good report than grateful
if gainst yourself you be incensed well put you
like one that means his proper harm in manacles
then reason safely with you therefore be it known
as to us to all the world that caius marcius
my noble steed known to the camp i give him
with all his trim belonging and from this time
for what he did before corioli call him
with all the applause and clamour of the host
caius marcius coriolanus bear
the addition nobly ever
caius marcius coriolanus
i will go wash
and when my face is fair you shall perceive
i mean to stride your steed and at all times
to undercrest your good addition
to the fairness of my power
so to our tent
where ere we do repose us we will write
to rome of our success you titus lartius
the best with whom we may articulate
for their own good and ours
i shall my lord
the gods begin to mock me i that now
refused most princely gifts am bound to beg
of my lord general
taket tis yours what ist
i sometime lay here in corioli
he cried to me i saw him prisoner
but then aufidius was within my view
to give my poor host freedom
o well beggd
were he the butcher of my son he should
be free as is the wind deliver him titus
marcius his name
by jupiter forgot
i am weary yea my memory is tired
have we no wine here
the blood upon your visage dries tis time
the town is taen
twill be deliverd back on good condition
condition
i would i were a roman for i cannot
being a volsce be that i am condition
what good condition can a treaty find
i the part that is at mercy five times marcius
and wouldst do so i think should we encounter
as often as we eat by the elements
if eer again i meet him beard to beard
hath not that honour int it had for where
i thought to crush him in an equal force
true sword to sword ill potch at him some way
or wrath or craft may get him
hes the devil
bolder though not so subtle my valours poisond
with only suffering stain by him for him
being naked sick nor fane nor capitol
the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice
embarquements all of fury shall lift up
their rotten privilege and custom gainst
at home upon my brothers guard even there
against the hospitable canon would i
wash my fierce hand ins heart go you to the city
learn how tis held and what they are that must
be hostages for rome
will not you go
tis south the city millsbring me word thither
how the world goes that to the pace of it
i may spur on my journey
i shall sir
the augurer tells me we shall have news tonight
good or bad
not according to the prayer of the people for they
love not marcius
nature teaches beasts to know their friends
pray you who does the wolf love
the lamb
ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the
noble marcius
hes a lamb indeed that baes like a bear
hes a bear indeed that lives like a lamb you two
well sir
in what enormity is marcius poor in that you two
have not in abundance
hes poor in no one fault but stored with all
especially in pride
and topping all others in boasting
censured here in the city i mean of us o the
righthand file do you
why how are we censured
because you talk of pride nowwill you not be angry
well well sir well
why tis no great matter for a very little thief of
give your dispositions the reins and be angry at
your pleasures at the least if you take it as a
pleasure to you in being so you blame marcius for
being proud
we do it not alone sir
i know you can do very little alone for your helps
are many or else your actions would grow wondrous
could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks
and make but an interior survey of your good selves
o that you could
what then sir
why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting
proud violent testy magistrates alias fools as
any in rome
menenius you are known well enough too
i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that
loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
tiber int said to be something imperfect in
favouring the first complaint hasty and tinderlike
upon too trivial motion one that converses more
with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
malice in my breath meeting two such wealsmen as
you arei cannot call you lycurgusesif the drink
you give me touch my palate adversely i make a
crooked face at it i cant say your worships have
delivered the matter well when i find the ass in
though i must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that
tell you you have good faces if you see this in
the map of my microcosm follows it that i am known
well enough too what barm can your bisson
conspectuities glean out of this character if i be
known well enough too
come sir come we know you well enough
you know neither me yourselves nor any thing you
wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
cause between an orange wife and a fossetseller
and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
second day of audience when you are hearing a
matter between party and party if you chance to be
pinched with the colic you make faces like
mummers set up the bloody flag against all
patience and in roaring for a chamberpot
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
cause is calling both the parties knaves you are
a pair of strange ones
come come you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the capitol
our very priests must become mockers if they shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are when
you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the
wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botchers
cushion or to be entombed in an asss pack
saddle yet you must be saying marcius is proud
who in a cheap estimation is worth predecessors
since deucalion though peradventure some of the
best of em were hereditary hangmen godden to
infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly
how now my as fair as noble ladiesand the moon
were she earthly no noblerwhither do you follow
your eyes so fast
honourable menenius my boy marcius approaches for
the love of juno lets go
ha marcius coming home
ay worthy menenius and with most prosperous
approbation
take my cap jupiter and i thank thee hoo
marcius coming home
naytis true
another his wife another and i think theres one
at home for you
me
yes certain theres a letter for you i sawt
a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven
years health in which time i will make a lip at
galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative
of no better report than a horsedrench is he
not wounded he was wont to come home wounded
o no no no
o he is wounded i thank the gods fort
victory in his pocket the wounds become him
with the oaken garland
has he disciplined aufidius soundly
titus lartius writes they fought together but
aufidius got off
an he had stayed by him i would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in corioli and the gold
thats in them is the senate possessed of this
good ladies lets go yes yes yes the senate
has letters from the general wherein he gives my
action outdone his former deeds doubly
in troth theres wondrous things spoke of him
wondrous ay i warrant you and not without his
true purchasing
the gods grant them true
true pow wow
true ill be sworn they are true
where is he wounded
god save your good worships marcius is coming
i the shoulder and i the left arm there will be
large cicatrices to show the people when he shall
stand for his place he received in the repulse of
tarquin seven hurts i the body
one i the neck and two i the thightheres
nine that i know
he had before this last expedition twentyfive
wounds upon him
hark the trumpets
death that dark spirit in s nervy arm doth lie
which being advanced declines and then men die
know rome that all alone marcius did fight
with fame a name to caius marcius these
in honour follows coriolanus
welcome to rome renowned coriolanus
welcome to rome renowned coriolanus
pray now no more
look sir your mother
o
you have i know petitiond all the gods
for my prosperity
nay my good soldier up
my gentle marcius worthy caius and
by deedachieving honour newly named
what is itcoriolanus must i call thee
but o thy wife
my gracious silence hail
wouldst thou have laughd had i come coffind home
that weepst to see me triumph ay my dear
such eyes the widows in corioli wear
and mothers that lack sons
now the gods crown thee
and live you yet
o my sweet lady pardon
a hundred thousand welcomes i could weep
and i could laugh i am light and heavy welcome
a curse begin at very root ons heart
that is not glad to see thee you are three
we have some old crabtrees here
at home that will not
we call a nettle but a nettle and
the faults of fools but folly
ever right
menenius ever ever
give way there and go on
i have lived
to see inherited my very wishes
theres one thing wanting which i doubt not but
our rome will cast upon thee
know good mother
i had rather be their servant in my way
than sway with them in theirs
on to the capitol
all tongues speak of him and the bleared sights
into a rapture lets her baby cry
her richest lockram bout her reechy neck
are smotherd up leads filld and ridges horsed
with variable complexions all agreeing
do press among the popular throngs and puff
commit the war of white and damask in
their nicelygawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
as if that whatsoever god who leads him
were slily crept into his human powers
and gave him graceful posture
on the sudden
i warrant him consul
then our office may
during his power go sleep
he cannot temperately transport his honours
from where he should begin and end but will
lose those he hath won
in that theres comfort
doubt not
the commoners for whom we stand but they
upon their ancient malice will forget
with the least cause these his new honours which
that he will give them make i as little question
as he is proud to dot
i heard him swear
were he to stand for consul never would he
appear i the marketplace nor on him put
the napless vesture of humility
nor showing as the manner is his wounds
to the people beg their stinking breaths
tis right
than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him
and the desire of the nobles
i wish no better
than have him hold that purpose and to put it
in execution
tis most like he will
it shall be to him then as our good wills
a sure destruction
so it must fall out
to him or our authorities for an end
we must suggest the people in what hatred
he still hath held them that tos power he would
have made them mules silenced their pleaders and
dispropertied their freedoms holding them
in human action and capacity
of no more soul nor fitness for the world
than camels in the war who have their provand
only for bearing burdens and sore blows
for sinking under them
this as you say suggested
at some time when his soaring insolence
shall touch the peoplewhich time shall not want
if he be put upon t and thats as easy
as to set dogs on sheepwill be his fire
to kindle their dry stubble and their blaze
shall darken him for ever
whats the matter
you are sent for to the capitol tis thought
i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers
as to joves statue and the commons made
i never saw the like
lets to the capitol
and carry with us ears and eyes for the time
but hearts for the event
have with you
come come they are almost here how many stand
for consulships
coriolanus will carry it
thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and
loves not the common people
faith there had been many great men that have
flattered the people who neer loved them and there
be many that they have loved they know not
coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly seet
if he did not care whether he had their love or no
he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither
devotion than can render it him and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite now to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes to flatter them for their love
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who
having been supple and courteous to the people
bonneted without any further deed to have them at
planted his honours in their eyes and his actions
in their hearts that for their tongues to be
silent and not confess so much were a kind of
ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a
malice that giving itself the lie would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it
are coming
having determined of the volsces and
to send for titus lartius it remains
as the main point of this our aftermeeting
to gratify his noble service that
please you
most reverend and grave elders to desire
the present consul and last general
in our wellfound successes to report
a little of that worthy work performd
by caius marcius coriolanus whom
we met here both to thank and to remember
with honours like himself
leave nothing out for length and make us think
rather our states defective for requital
than we to stretch it out
masters o the people
we do request your kindest ears and after
your loving motion toward the common body
to yield what passes here
we are convented
upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts
inclinable to honour and advance
the theme of our assembly
which the rather
we shall be blest to do if he remember
a kinder value of the people than
he hath hereto prized them at
thats off thats off
i would you rather had been silent please you
to hear cominius speak
most willingly
but yet my caution was more pertinent
than the rebuke you give it
he loves your people
but tie him not to be their bedfellow
worthy cominius speak
nay keep your place
sit coriolanus never shame to hear
what you have nobly done
i had rather have my wounds to heal again
than hear say how i got them
sir i hope
my words disbenchd you not
when blows have made me stay i fled from words
your people
i love them as they weigh
pray now sit down
i had rather have one scratch my head i the sun
when the alarum were struck than idly sit
to hear my nothings monsterd
masters of the people
your multiplying spawn how can he flatter
thats thousand to one good onewhen you now see
he had rather venture all his limbs for honour
than one ons ears to hear it proceed cominius
should not be utterd feebly it is held
that valour is the chiefest virtue and
the man i speak of cannot in the world
be singly counterpoised at sixteen years
when tarquin made a head for rome he fought
whom with all praise i point at saw him fight
when with his amazonian chin he drove
an oerpressd roman and i the consuls view
when he might act the woman in the scene
he proved best man i the field and for his meed
was browbound with the oak his pupil age
manenterd thus he waxed like a sea
and in the brunt of seventeen battles since
he lurchd all swords of the garland for this last
before and in corioli let me say
and by his rare example made the coward
a vessel under sail so men obeyd
where it did mark it took from face to foot
he was a thing of blood whose every motion
the mortal gate of the city which he painted
with shunless destiny aidless came off
and with a sudden reinforcement struck
when by and by the din of war gan pierce
his ready sense then straight his doubled spirit
requickend what in flesh was fatigate
and to the battle came he where he did
run reeking oer the lives of men as if
both field and city ours he never stood
to ease his breast with panting
worthy man
he cannot but with measure fit the honours
which we devise him
our spoils he kickd at
and lookd upon things precious as they were
than misery itself would give rewards
his deeds with doing them and is content
to spend the time to end it
let him be calld for
call coriolanus
he doth appear
the senate coriolanus are well pleased
to make thee consul
i do owe them still
my life and services
it then remains
that you do speak to the people
i do beseech you
let me oerleap that custom for i cannot
put on the gown stand naked and entreat them
that i may pass this doing
sir the people
must have their voices neither will they bate
one jot of ceremony
pray you go fit you to the custom and
take to you as your predecessors have
your honour with your form
it is apart
that i shall blush in acting and might well
be taken from the people
mark you that
to brag unto them thus i did and thus
show them the unaching scars which i should hide
as if i had received them for the hire
of their breath only
do not stand upont
we recommend to you tribunes of the people
wish we all joy and honour
to coriolanus come all joy and honour
you see how he intends to use the people
may they perceives intent he will require them
as if he did contemn what he requested
should be in them to give
come well inform them
i know they do attend us
once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him
we may sir if we will
we have power in ourselves to do it but it is a
power that we have no power to do for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if
he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them ingratitude is
monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful
which we being members should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members
and to make us no better thought of a little help
will serve for once we stood up about the corn he
himself stuck not to call us the manyheaded multitude
we have been called so of many not that our heads
are some brown some black some auburn some bald
truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull they would fly east west north south
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o the compass
think you so which way do you judge my wit would
fly
nay your wit will not so soon out as another mans
willtis strongly wedged up in a blockhead but
if it were at liberty twould sure southward
why that way
to lose itself in a fog where being three parts
melted away with rotten dews the fourth would return
for conscience sake to help to get thee a wife
are you all resolved to give your voices but
thats no matter the greater part carries it i
say if he would incline to the people there was
never a worthier man
behavior we are not to stay all together but to
come by him where he stands by ones by twos and
by threes hes to make his requests by
particulars wherein every one of us has a single
honour in giving him our own voices with our own
you shall go by him
content content
the worthiest men have donet
what must i say
i pray sirplague upont i cannot bring
i got them in my countrys service when
some certain of your brethren roard and ran
from the noise of our own drums
o me the gods
to think upon you
think upon me hang em
i would they would forget me like the virtues
which our divines lose by em
in wholesome manner
bid them wash their faces
and keep their teeth clean
so here comes a brace
you know the cause air of my standing here
we do sir tell us what hath brought you tot
mine own desert
your own desert
ay but not mine own desire
how not your own desire
no sirtwas never my desire yet to trouble the
poor with begging
you must think if we give you any thing we hope to
gain by you
well then i pray your price o the consulship
the price is to ask it kindly
show you which shall be yours in private your
good voice sir what say you
you shall ha it worthy sir
a match sir theres in all two worthy voices
but this is something odd
an twere to give againbut tis no matter
pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your
voices that i may be consul i have here the
customary gown
you have deserved nobly of your country and you
have not deserved nobly
your enigma
you have been a scourge to her enemies you have
been a rod to her friends you have not indeed loved
the common people
you should account me the more virtuous that i have
not been common in my love i will sir flatter my
sworn brother the people to earn a dearer
estimation of them tis a condition they account
rather to have my hat than my heart i will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly that is sir i will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers therefore beseech you
i may be consul
we hope to find you our friend and therefore give
you our voices heartily
you have received many wounds for your country
i will not seal your knowledge with showing them i
will make much of your voices and so trouble you no further
the gods give you joy sir heartily
most sweet voices
better it is to die better to starve
than crave the hire which first we do deserve
why in this woolvish toge should i stand here
to beg of hob and dick that do appear
what custom wills in all things should we dot
the dust on antique time would lie unswept
and mountainous error be too highly heapt
for truth to oerpeer rather than fool it so
let the high office and the honour go
to one that would do thus i am half through
the one part sufferd the other will i do
here come more voices
watchd for your voices for your voices bear
of wounds two dozen odd battles thrice six
i have seen and heard of for your voices have
indeed i would be consul
he has done nobly and cannot go without any honest
mans voice
and make him good friend to the people
amen amen god save thee noble consul
worthy voices
you have stood your limitation and the tribunes
that in the official marks invested you
anon do meet the senate
is this done
the people do admit you and are summond
to meet anon upon your approbation
where at the senatehouse
there coriolanus
may i change these garments
you may sir
that ill straight do and knowing myself again
repair to the senatehouse
ill keep you company will you along
we stay here for the people
fare you well
he has it now and by his looks methink
tis warm at s heart
with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds
will you dismiss the people
how now my masters have you chose this man
he has our voices sir
we pray the gods he may deserve your loves
he mockd us when he beggd our voices
certainly
he flouted us downright
not one amongst us save yourself but says
his marks of merit wounds received fors country
why so he did i am sure
no no no man saw em
he said he had wounds which he could show
in private
and with his hat thus waving it in scorn
but by your voices will not so permit me
your voices therefore when we granted that
your voices
i have no further with you was not this mockery
why either were you ignorant to seet
or seeing it of such childish friendliness
to yield your voices
could you not have told him
as you were lessond when he had no power
but was a petty servant to the state
he was your enemy ever spake against
your liberties and the charters that you bear
i the body of the weal and now arriving
a place of potency and sway o the state
if he should still malignantly remain
fast foe to the plebeii your voices might
be curses to yourselves you should have said
that as his worthy deeds did claim no less
than what he stood for so his gracious nature
would think upon you for your voices and
translate his malice towards you into love
standing your friendly lord
thus to have said
as you were foreadvised had touchd his spirit
and tried his inclination from him pluckd
either his gracious promise which you might
as cause had calld you up have held him to
or else it would have galld his surly nature
which easily endures not article
tying him to aught so putting him to rage
you should have taen the advantage of his choler
and passd him unelected
did you perceive
he did solicit you in free contempt
when he did need your loves and do you think
that his contempt shall not be bruising to you
when he hath power to crush why had your bodies
no heart among you or had you tongues to cry
against the rectorship of judgment
have you
ere now denied the asker and now again
of him that did not ask but mock bestow
your suedfor tongues
hes not confirmd we may deny him yet
ill have five hundred voices of that sound
i twice five hundred and their friends to piece em
get you hence instantly and tell those friends
they have chose a consul that will from them take
their liberties make them of no more voice
than dogs that are as often beat for barking
as therefore kept to do so
let them assemble
and on a safer judgment all revoke
your ignorant election enforce his pride
and his old hate unto you besides forget not
with what contempt he wore the humble weed
how in his suit he scornd you but your loves
thinking upon his services took from you
the apprehension of his present portance
which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion
after the inveterate hate he bears you
lay
a fault on us your tribunes that we laboured
no impediment between but that you must
cast your election on him
say you chose him
more after our commandment than as guided
by your own true affections and that your minds
preoccupied with what you rather must do
than what you should made you against the grain
ay spare us not say we read lectures to you
how youngly he began to serve his country
how long continued and what stock he springs of
the noble house o the marcians from whence came
that ancus marcius numas daughters son
who after great hostilius here was king
of the same house publius and quintus were
that our beat water brought by conduits hither
and
twice being
was his great ancestor
one thus descended
that hath beside well in his person wrought
to be set high in place we did commend
scaling his present bearing with his past
that hes your fixed enemy and revoke
your sudden approbation
say you neer had donet
harp on that stillbut by our putting on
and presently when you have drawn your number
repair to the capitol
repent in their election
let them go on
this mutiny were better put in hazard
if as his nature is he fall in rage
with their refusal both observe and answer
the vantage of his anger
we will be there before the stream o the people
and this shall seem as partly tis their own
which we have goaded onward
tullus aufidius then had made new head
he had my lord and that it was which caused
our swifter composition
so then the volsces stand but as at first
ready when time shall prompt them to make road
upons again
they are worn lord consul so
that we shall hardly in our ages see
their banners wave again
saw you aufidius
on safeguard he came to me and did curse
against the volsces for they had so vilely
spoke he of me
he did my lord
how what
how often he had met you sword to sword
that of all things upon the earth he hated
your person most that he would pawn his fortunes
to hopeless restitution so he might
be calld your vanquisher
at antium lives he
at antium
i wish i had a cause to seek him there
to oppose his hatred fully welcome home
behold these are the tribunes of the people
for they do prank them in authority
against all noble sufferance
pass no further
ha what is that
what makes this change
the matter
hath he not passd the noble and the common
cominius no
have i had childrens voices
tribunes give way he shall to the marketplace
the people are incensed against him
stop
or all will fall in broil
are these your herd
must these have voices that can yield them now
and straight disclaim their tongues what are
your offices
you being their mouths why rule you not their teeth
have you not set them on
be calm be calm
it is a purposed thing and grows by plot
suffert and live with such as cannot rule
nor ever will be ruled
the people cry you mockd them and of late
when corn was given them gratis you repined
scandald the suppliants for the people calld them
timepleasers flatterers foes to nobleness
why this was known before
not to them all
have you informd them sithence
how i inform them
you are like to do such business
not unlike
each way to better yours
why then should i be consul by yond clouds
let me deserve so ill as you and make me
your fellow tribune
you show too much of that
to where you are bound you must inquire your way
which you are out of with a gentler spirit
or never be so noble as a consul
nor yoke with him for tribune
lets be calm
the people are abused set on this paltering
becomes not rome nor has coriolanus
deserved this so dishonourd rub laid falsely
i the plain way of his merit
tell me of corn
this was my speech and i will speakt again
not now not now
not in this heat sir now
now as i live i will my nobler friends
for the mutable rankscented many let them
regard me as i do not flatter and
in soothing them we nourish gainst our senate
the cockle of rebellion insolence sedition
which we ourselves have ploughd for sowd
and scatterd
by mingling them with us the honourd number
who lack not virtue no nor power but that
which they have given to beggars
well no more
no more words we beseech you
how no more
as for my country i have shed my blood
not fearing outward force so shall my lungs
coin words till their decay against those measles
which we disdain should tatter us yet sought
the very way to catch them
you speak o the people
as if you were a god to punish not
a man of their infirmity
twere well
we let the people knowt
what what his choler
choler
were i as patient as the midnight sleep
by jove twould be my mind
it is a mind
that shall remain a poison where it is
not poison any further
shall remain
hear you this triton of the minnows mark you
his absolute shall
twas from the canon
shall
o good but most unwise patricians why
you grave but reckless senators have you thus
given hydra here to choose an officer
that with his peremptory shall being but
the horn and noise o the monsters wants not spirit
to say hell turn your current in a ditch
and make your channel his if he have power
then vail your ignorance if none awake
your dangerous lenity if you are learnd
be not as common fools if you are not
let them have cushions by you you are plebeians
when both your voices blended the greatst taste
most palates theirs they choose their magistrate
and such a one as he who puts his shall
his popular shall against a graver bench
than ever frown in greece by jove himself
to know when two authorities are up
neither supreme how soon confusion
may enter twixt the gap of both and take
the one by the other
well on to the marketplace
whoever gave that counsel to give forth
the corn o the storehouse gratis as twas used
sometime in greece
well well no more of that
though there the people had more absolute power
i say they nourishd disobedience fed
the ruin of the state
why shall the people give
one that speaks thus their voice
ill give my reasons
more worthier than their voices they know the corn
was not our recompense resting well assured
even when the navel of the state was touchd
they would not thread the gates this kind of service
did not deserve corn gratis being i the war
their mutinies and revolts wherein they showd
which they have often made against the senate
all cause unborn could never be the motive
of our so frank donation well what then
how shall this bisson multitude digest
the senates courtesy let deeds express
we are the greater poll and in true fear
they gave us our demands thus we debase
the nature of our seats and make the rabble
call our cares fears which will in time
break ope the locks o the senate and bring in
the crows to peck the eagles
come enough
enough with overmeasure
what may be sworn by both divine and human
seal what i end withal this double worship
where one part does disdain with cause the other
insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom
cannot conclude but by the yea and no
of general ignoranceit must omit
real necessities and give way the while
it follows
nothing is done to purpose therefore beseech you
you that will be less fearful than discreet
that love the fundamental part of state
more than you doubt the change ont that prefer
a noble life before a long and wish
to jump a body with a dangerous physic
thats sure of death without it at once pluck out
the multitudinous tongue let them not lick
mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
of that integrity which should becomet
not having the power to do the good it would
for the in which doth controlt
has said enough
has spoken like a traitor and shall answer
as traitors do
thou wretch despite oerwhelm thee
what should the people do with these bald tribunes
on whom depending their obedience fails
when whats not meet but what must be was law
let what is meet be said it must be meet
and throw their power i the dust
manifest treason
this a consul no
the aediles ho
let him be apprehended
in whose name myself
attach thee as a traitorous innovator
and follow to thine answer
hence old goat
well surety him
aged sir hands off
hence rotten thing or i shall shake thy bones
out of thy garments
help ye citizens
on both sides more respect
heres he that would take from you all your power
seize him aediles
down with him down with him
weapons weapons weapons
tribunes patricians citizens what ho
sicinius brutus coriolanus citizens
peace peace peace stay hold peace
what is about to be i am out of breath
confusions near i cannot speak you tribunes
to the people coriolanus patience
speak good sicinius
hear me people peace
marcius would have all from you marcius
whom late you have named for consul
fie fie fie
this is the way to kindle not to quench
to unbuild the city and to lay all flat
what is the city but the people
true
the people are the city
by the consent of all we were establishd
the peoples magistrates
you so remain
and so are like to do
that is the way to lay the city flat
to bring the roof to the foundation
and bury all which yet distinctly ranges
in heaps and piles of ruin
this deserves death
or let us stand to our authority
or let us lose it we do here pronounce
upon the part o the people in whose power
we were elected theirs marcius is worthy
of present death
therefore lay hold of him
bear him to the rock tarpeian and from thence
into destruction cast him
aediles seize him
yield marcius yield
hear me one word
beseech you tribunes hear me but a word
peace peace
sir those cold ways
that seem like prudent helps are very poisonous
where the disease is violent lay hands upon him
and bear him to the rock
no ill die here
come try upon yourselves what you have seen me
down with that sword tribunes withdraw awhile
lay hands upon him
help marcius help
you that be noble help him young and old
down with him down with him
go get you to your house be gone away
all will be naught else
get you gone
stand fast
we have as many friends as enemies
sham it be put to that
the gods forbid
i prithee noble friend home to thy house
leave us to cure this cause
for tis a sore upon us
come sir along with us
i would they were barbariansas they are
though in rome litterdnot romansas they are not
though calved i the porch o the capitol
be gone
put not your worthy rage into your tongue
one time will owe another
on fair ground
i could beat forty of them
i could myself
take up a brace o the best of them yea the
but now tis odds beyond arithmetic
and manhood is calld foolery when it stands
against a falling fabric will you hence
before the tag return whose rage doth rend
like interrupted waters and oerbear
what they are used to bear
ill try whether my old wit be in request
with cloth of any colour
nay come away
this man has marrd his fortune
he would not flatter neptune for his trident
what his breast forges that his tongue must vent
and being angry does forget that ever
he heard the name of death
heres goodly work
i would they were abed
i would they were in tiber what the vengeance
could he not speak em fair
where is this viper
that would depopulate the city and
be every man himself
you worthy tribunes
he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock
and therefore law shall scorn him further trial
than the severity of the public power
which he so sets at nought
he shall well know
the noble tribunes are the peoples mouths
and we their hands
he shall sure ont
sir sir
peace
do not cry havoc where you should but hunt
with modest warrant
sir how comest that you
have holp to make this rescue
as i do know the consuls worthiness
so can i name his faults
consul what consul
the consul coriolanus
he consul
no no no no no
if by the tribunes leave and yours good people
i may be heard i would crave a word or two
the which shall turn you to no further harm
than so much loss of time
speak briefly then
for we are peremptory to dispatch
were but one danger and to keep him here
he dies tonight
now the good gods forbid
that our renowned rome whose gratitude
towards her deserved children is enrolld
in joves own book like an unnatural dam
should now eat up her own
hes a disease that must be cut away
o hes a limb that has but a disease
mortal to cut it off to cure it easy
what has he done to rome thats worthy death
killing our enemies the blood he hath lost
which i dare vouch is more than that he hath
by many an ouncehe droppd it for his country
and what is left to lose it by his country
were to us all that dot and suffer it
a brand to the end o the world
this is clean kam
it honourd him
the service of the foot
being once gangrened is not then respected
for what before it was
well hear no more
lest his infection being of catching nature
spread further
one word more one word
this tigerfooted rage when it shall find
the harm of unscannd swiftness will too late
tie leaden pounds tos heels proceed by process
lest parties as he is beloved break out
and sack great rome with romans
if it were so
what do ye talk
have we not had a taste of his obedience
our aediles smote ourselves resisted come
since he could draw a sword and is ill schoold
in bolted language meal and bran together
he throws without distinction give me leave
ill go to him and undertake to bring him
where he shall answer by a lawful form
in peace to his utmost peril
noble tribunes
will prove too bloody and the end of it
unknown to the beginning
noble menenius
be you then as the peoples officer
masters lay down your weapons
go not home
where if you bring not marcius well proceed
in our first way
ill bring him to you
or what is worst will follow
pray you lets to him
let them puff all about mine ears present me
death on the wheel or at wild horses heels
or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock
that the precipitation might down stretch
below the beam of sight yet will i still
be thus to them
you do the nobler
i muse my mother
does not approve me further who was wont
to call them woollen vassals things created
to buy and sell with groats to show bare heads
in congregations to yawn be still and wonder
when one but of my ordinance stood up
to speak of peace or war
why did you wish me milder would you have me
false to my nature rather say i play
the man i am
o sir sir sir
i would have had you put your power well on
before you had worn it out
let go
you might have been enough the man you are
with striving less to be so lesser had been
the thwartings of your dispositions if
you had not showd them how ye were disposed
ere they lackd power to cross you
let them hang
ay and burn too
come come you have been too rough something
too rough
you must return and mend it
theres no remedy
unless by not so doing our good city
cleave in the midst and perish
i have a heart as little apt as yours
but yet a brain that leads my use of anger
to better vantage
well said noble woman
before he should thus stoop to the herd but that
the violent fit o the time craves it as physic
for the whole state i would put mine armour on
which i can scarcely bear
what must i do
return to the tribunes
well what then what then
repent what you have spoke
for them i cannot do it to the gods
must i then dot to them
you are too absolute
though therein you can never be too noble
but when extremities speak i have heard you say
honour and policy like unseverd friends
in peace what each of them by the other lose
that they combine not there
tush tush
a good demand
if it be honour in your wars to seem
the same you are not which for your best ends
you adopt your policy how is it less or worse
that it shall hold companionship in peace
with honour as in war since that to both
it stands in like request
why force you this
because that now it lies you on to speak
to the people not by your own instruction
nor by the matter which your heart prompts you
but with such words that are but rooted in
your tongue though but bastards and syllables
of no allowance to your bosoms truth
now this no more dishonours you at all
than to take in a town with gentle words
which else would put you to your fortune and
the hazard of much blood
i would dissemble with my nature where
my fortunes and my friends at stake required
your wife your son these senators the nobles
and you will rather show our general louts
how you can frown than spend a fawn upon em
for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
of what that want might ruin
noble lady
not what is dangerous present but the loss
of what is past
i prithee now my son
go to them with this bonnet in thy hand
and thus far having stretchd ithere be with them
thy knee bussing the stonesfor in such business
action is eloquence and the eyes of the ignorant
more learned than the earswaving thy head
which often thus correcting thy stout heart
now humble as the ripest mulberry
thou art their soldier and being bred in broils
hast not the soft way which thou dost confess
were fit for thee to use as they to claim
in asking their good loves but thou wilt frame
thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far
as thou hast power and person
this but done
even as she speaks why their hearts were yours
for they have pardons being askd as free
as words to little purpose
prithee now
follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
than flatter him in a bower here is cominius
i have been i the marketplace and sirtis fit
you make strong party or defend yourself
only fair speech
i think twill serve if he
can thereto frame his spirit
he must and will
prithee now say you will and go about it
must i go show them my unbarbed sconce
must i with base tongue give my noble heart
yet were there but this single plot to lose
this mould of marcius they to dust should grind it
and throwt against the wind to the marketplace
you have put me now to such a part which never
i shall discharge to the life
come come well prompt you
i prithee now sweet son as thou hast said
my praises made thee first a soldier so
to have my praise for this perform a part
thou hast not done before
away my disposition and possess me
some harlots spirit my throat of war be turnd
which quired with my drum into a pipe
small as an eunuch or the virgin voice
that babies lulls asleep the smiles of knaves
tent in my cheeks and schoolboys tears take up
the glasses of my sight a beggars tongue
make motion through my lips and my armd knees
who bowd but in my stirrup bend like his
that hath received an alms i will not dot
lest i surcease to honour mine own truth
and by my bodys action teach my mind
a most inherent baseness
to beg of thee it is my more dishonour
than thou of them come all to ruin let
thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
thy dangerous stoutness for i mock at death
with as big heart as thou do as thou list
thy valiantness was mine thou suckdst it from me
but owe thy pride thyself
mother i am going to the marketplace
chide me no more ill mountebank their loves
cog their hearts from them and come home beloved
commend me to my wife ill return consul
or never trust to what my tongue can do
i the way of flattery further
do your will
to answer mildly for they are prepared
with accusations as i hear more strong
than are upon you yet
let them accuse me by invention i
will answer in mine honour
ay but mildly
well mildly be it then mildly
in this point charge him home that he affects
enforce him with his envy to the people
and that the spoil got on the antiates
was neer distributed
what will he come
hes coming
how accompanied
with old menenius and those senators
that always favourd him
have you a catalogue
of all the voices that we have procured
set down by the poll
i have tis ready
have you collected them by tribes
i have
assemble presently the people hither
and when they bear me say it shall be so
i the right and strength o the commons be it either
for death for fine or banishment then let them
if i say fine cry fine if death cry death
insisting on the old prerogative
and power i the truth o the cause
i shall inform them
and when such time they have begun to cry
let them not cease but with a din confused
enforce the present execution
of what we chance to sentence
very well
make them be strong and ready for this hint
when we shall hap to give t them
go about it
ever to conquer and to have his worth
be reind again to temperance then he speaks
whats in his heart and that is there which looks
with us to break his neck
well here he comes
calmly i do beseech you
ay as an ostler that for the poorest piece
will bear the knave by the volume the honourd gods
keep rome in safety and the chairs of justice
supplied with worthy men plant love among s
throng our large temples with the shows of peace
and not our streets with war
amen amen
a noble wish
draw near ye people
first hear me speak
well say peace ho
shall i be charged no further than this present
must all determine here
i do demand
if you submit you to the peoples voices
allow their officers and are content
to suffer lawful censure for such faults
as shall be proved upon you
i am content
the warlike service he has done consider think
upon the wounds his body bears which show
like graves i the holy churchyard
scratches with briers
scars to move laughter only
consider further
that when he speaks not like a citizen
his rougher accents for malicious sounds
but as i say such as become a soldier
rather than envy you
well well no more
what is the matter
that being passd for consul with full voice
i am so dishonourd that the very hour
you take it off again
answer to us
we charge you that you have contrived to take
from rome all seasond office and to wind
yourself into a power tyrannical
for which you are a traitor to the people
how traitor
nay temperately your promise
the fires i the lowest hell foldin the people
call me their traitor thou injurious tribune
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths
in thy hand clutchd as many millions in
thy lying tongue both numbers i would say
thou liest unto thee with a voice as free
as i do pray the gods
mark you this people
to the rock to the rock with him
peace
what you have seen him do and heard him speak
beating your officers cursing yourselves
opposing laws with strokes and here defying
those whose great power must try him even this
so criminal and in such capital kind
deserves the extremest death
but since he hath
served well for rome
what do you prate of service
i talk of that that know it
you
is this the promise that you made your mother
know i pray you
let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death
vagabond exile raying pent to linger
but with a grain a day i would not buy
their mercy at the price of one fair word
nor cheque my courage for what they can give
to havet with saying good morrow
for that he has
as much as in him lies from time to time
envied against the people seeking means
to pluck away their power as now at last
given hostile strokes and that not in the presence
of dreaded justice but on the ministers
that do distribute it in the name o the people
and in the power of us the tribunes we
even from this instant banish him our city
in peril of precipitation
from off the rock tarpeian never more
i say it shall be so
hes banishd and it shall be so
hear me my masters and my common friends
hes sentenced no more hearing
i have been consul and can show for rome
her enemies marks upon me i do love
my countrys good with a respect more tender
more holy and profound than mine own life
my dear wifes estimate her wombs increase
and treasure of my loins then if i would
speak that
theres no more to be said but he is banishd
it shall be so
it shall be so it shall be so
you common cry of curs whose breath i hate
as reek o the rotten fens whose loves i prize
as the dead carcasses of unburied men
that do corrupt my air i banish you
and here remain with your uncertainty
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts
your enemies with nodding of their plumes
fan you into despair have the power still
to banish your defenders till at length
your ignorance which finds not till it feels
making not reservation of yourselves
still your own foes deliver you as most
abated captives to some nation
that won you without blows despising
there is a world elsewhere
the peoples enemy is gone is gone
our enemy is banishd he is gone hoo hoo
go see him out at gates and follow him
as he hath followed you with all despite
give him deserved vexation let a guard
attend us through the city
come come lets see him out at gates come
the gods preserve our noble tribunes come
with many heads butts me away nay mother
where is your ancient courage you were used
to say extremity was the trier of spirits
that common chances common men could bear
that when the sea was calm all boats alike
showd mastership in floating fortunes blows
when most struck home being gentle wounded craves
with precepts that would make invincible
the heart that connd them
o heavens o heavens
nay prithee woman
now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome
and occupations perish
what what what
i shall be loved when i am lackd nay mother
resume that spirit when you were wont to say
if you had been the wife of hercules
six of his labours yould have done and saved
your husband so much sweat cominius
ill do well yet thou old and true menenius
thy tears are salter than a younger mans
and venomous to thine eyes my sometime general
i have seen thee stem and thou hast oft beheld
hearthardening spectacles tell these sad women
tis fond to wail inevitable strokes
as tis to laugh at em my mother you wot well
believet not lightlythough i go alone
like to a lonely dragon that his fen
makes feard and talkd of more than seenyour son
will or exceed the common or be caught
with cautelous baits and practise
my first son
whither wilt thou go take good cominius
more than a wild exposture to each chance
that starts i the way before thee
o the gods
ill follow thee a month devise with thee
where thou shalt rest that thou mayst hear of us
a cause for thy repeal we shall not send
oer the vast world to seek a single man
and lose advantage which doth ever cool
i the absence of the needer
thou hast years upon thee and thou art too full
of the wars surfeits to go rove with one
come my sweet wife my dearest mother and
my friends of noble touch when i am forth
bid me farewell and smile i pray you come
while i remain above the ground you shall
hear from me still and never of me aught
but what is like me formerly

if i could shake off but one seven years
from these old arms and legs by the good gods
ild with thee every foot
bid them all home hes gone and well no further
the nobility are vexd whom we see have sided
in his behalf
now we have shown our power

people against the senators patricians and nobles

breaking out

how sir do you meddle with my master
ay tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress thou pratest and pratest serve with thy
trencher hence
where is this fellow
disturbing the lords within
whence comest thou what wouldst thou thy name
if tullus
not yet thou knowest me and seeing me dost not
think me for the man i am necessity
commands me name myself
what is thy name
a name unmusical to the volscians ears
and harsh in sound to thine
say whats thy name
thou hast a grim appearance and thy face
bears a command int though thy tackles torn
thou me yet
my name is caius marcius who hath done
to thee particularly and to all the volsces
great hurt and mischief thereto witness may
the extreme dangers and the drops of blood
shed for my thankless country are requited
but with that surname a good memory
and witness of the malice and displeasure
the cruelty and envy of the people
permitted by our dastard nobles who
have all forsook me hath devourd the rest
and sufferd me by the voice of slaves to be
whoopd out of rome now this extremity
hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope
mistake me notto save my life for if
i had feard death of all the men i the world
i would have voided thee but in mere spite
to be full quit of those my banishers
stand i before thee here then if thou hast
a heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge
thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
of shame seen through thy country speed
thee straight
that my revengeful services may prove
as benefits to thee for i will fight
against my cankerd country with the spleen
of all the under fiends but if so be
thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
thourt tired then in a word i also am
longer to live most weary and present
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice
which not to cut would show thee but a fool
since i have ever followd thee with hate
drawn tuns of blood out of thy countrys breast
and cannot live but to thy shame unless
it be to do thee service
o marcius marcius
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
a root of ancient envy if jupiter
should from yond cloud speak divine things
and say tis true ild not believe them more
than thee all noble marcius let me twine
mine arms about that body where against
my grained ash an hundred times hath broke
the anvil of my sword and do contest
as hotly and as nobly with thy love
as ever in ambitious strength i did
contend against thy valour know thou first
i loved the maid i married never man
sighd truer breath but that i see thee here
thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart
than when i first my wedded mistress saw
bestride my threshold why thou mars i tell thee
we have a power on foot and i had purpose
once more to hew thy target from thy brawn
twelve several times and i have nightly since
dreamt of encounters twixt thyself and me
we have been down together in my sleep
unbuckling helms fisting each others throat
and waked half dead with nothing worthy marcius
had we no quarrel else to rome but that
thou art thence banishd we would muster all
from twelve to seventy and pouring war
into the bowels of ungrateful rome
like a bold flood oerbear o come go in
and take our friendly senators by the hands
who now are here taking their leaves of me
who am prepared against your territories
though not for rome itself
you bless me gods
therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have
the leading of thine own revenges take
the one half of my commission and set down
as best thou art experienced since thou knowst
thy countrys strength and weaknessthine own ways
whether to knock against the gates of rome
or rudely visit them in parts remote
let me commend thee first to those that shall
say yea to thy desires a thousand welcomes
and more a friend than eer an enemy
heres a strange alteration
by my hand i had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him
what an arm he has he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb as one would set up a top
nay i knew by his face that there was something in
cannot tell how to term it
he had so looking as it werewould i were hanged
but i thought there was more in him than i could think
man i the world
who my master
nay its no matter for that
worth six on him
greater soldier
for the defence of a town our general is excellent
ay and for an assault too
o slaves i can tell you news news you rascals
what what what lets partake
i would not be a roman of all nations i had as
lieve be a condemned man
wherefore wherefore
why heres he that was wont to thwack our general
caius marcius
why do you say thwack our general 
i do not say thwack our general but he was always
good enough for him
hard for him i have heard him say so himself
he was too hard for him directly to say the troth
him like a carbon ado
an he had been cannibally given he might have
broiled and eaten him too
but more of thy news
why he is so made on here within as if he were son
and heir to mars set at upper end o the table no
question asked him by any of the senators but they
turns up the white o the eye to his discourse but
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table hell go he says
will mow all down before him and leave his passage polled
and hes as like to dot as any man i can imagine
dot he will dot for look you sir he has as
many friends as enemies which friends sir as it
were durst not look you sir show themselves as
we term it his friends whilst hes in directitude
directitude whats that
but when they shall see sir his crest up again
and the man in blood they will out of their
burrows like conies after rain and revel all with
him
but when goes this forward
tomorrow today presently you shall have the
parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips
why then we shall have a stirring world again
this peace is nothing but to rust iron increase
tailors and breed balladmakers
let me have war say i it exceeds peace as far as
day does night its spritely waking audible and
full of vent peace is a very apoplexy lethargy
mulled deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more
bastard children than wars a destroyer of men
be a ravisher so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds
ay and it makes men hate one another
reason because they then less need one another
the wars for my money i hope to see romans as cheap
as volscians they are rising they are rising
in in in in
we hear not of him neither need we fear him
his remedies are tame i the present peace
and quietness of the people which before
were in wild hurry here do we make his friends
blush that the world goes well who rather had
though they themselves did suffer byt behold
dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
our tradesmen with in their shops and going
about their functions friendly
we stood tot in good time
is this menenius
hail sir
hail to you both
your coriolanus
the commonwealth doth stand and so would do
were he more angry at it
alls well and might have been much better if
he could have temporized
where is he hear you
hear nothing from him
the gods preserve you both
godden our neighbours
godden to you all godden to you all
ourselves our wives and children on our knees
are bound to pray for you both
live and thrive
had loved you as we did
now the gods keep you
farewell farewell
this is a happier and more comely time
than when these fellows ran about the streets
crying confusion
caius marcius was
a worthy officer i the war but insolent
oercome with pride ambitious past all thinking
selfloving
and affecting one sole throne
without assistance
i think not so
we should by this to all our lamentation
if he had gone forth consul found it so
the gods have well prevented it and rome
sits safe and still without him
worthy tribunes
there is a slave whom we have put in prison
reports the volsces with two several powers
are enterd in the roman territories
and with the deepest malice of the war
destroy what lies before em
tis aufidius
who hearing of our marcius banishment
thrusts forth his horns again into the world
which were inshelld when marcius stood for rome
and durst not once peep out
come what talk you
of marcius
go see this rumourer whippd it cannot be
the volsces dare break with us
cannot be
we have record that very well it can
and three examples of the like have been
within my age but reason with the fellow
before you punish him where he heard this
lest you shall chance to whip your information
and beat the messenger who bids beware
of what is to be dreaded
i know this cannot be
not possible
the nobles in great earnestness are going
that turns their countenances
tis this slave
nothing but his report
yes worthy sir
the slaves report is seconded and more
more fearful is deliverd
what more fearful
it is spoke freely out of many mouths
how probable i do not knowthat marcius
joind with aufidius leads a power gainst rome
and vows revenge as spacious as between
the youngst and oldest thing
this is most likely
raised only that the weaker sort may wish
good marcius home again
the very trick ont
he and aufidius can no more atone
than violentest contrariety
a fearful army led by caius marcius
associated with aufidius rages
upon our territories and have already
oerborne their way consumed with fire and took
what lay before them
o you have made good work
what news what news
you have holp to ravish your own daughters and
to melt the city leads upon your pates
to see your wives dishonourd to your noses
whats the news whats the news
your temples burned in their cement and
your franchises whereon you stood confined
into an augers bore
pray now your news
you have made fair work i fear mepray your news
if marcius should be joind with volscians
if
made by some other deity than nature
that shapes man better and they follow him
against us brats with no less confidence
than boys pursuing summer butterflies
or butchers killing flies
you have made good work
you and your apronmen you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
the breath of garliceaters
he will shake
your rome about your ears
as hercules
did shake down mellow fruit
you have made fair work
but is this true sir
ay and youll look pale
before you find it other all the regions
do smilingly revolt and who resist
are mockd for valiant ignorance
and perish constant fools who ist can blame him
your enemies and his find something in him
we are all undone unless
the noble man have mercy
who shall ask it
the tribunes cannot dot for shame the people
deserve such pity of him as the wolf
should say be good to rome they charged him even
as those should do that had deserved his hate
and therein showd like enemies
if he were putting to my house the brand
that should consume it i have not the face
to say beseech you cease you have made fair hands
you and your crafts you have crafted fair
you have brought
a trembling upon rome such as was never
so incapable of help
say not we brought it
how was it we we loved him but like beasts
and cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters
who did hoot him out o the city
but i fear
theyll roar him in again tullus aufidius
the second name of men obeys his points
is all the policy strength and defence
that rome can make against them
here come the clusters
and is aufidius with him you are they
that made the air unwholesome when you cast
your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
coriolanus exile now hes coming
and not a hair upon a soldiers head
as you threw caps up will he tumble down
and pay you for your voices tis no matter
if he could burn us all into one coal
we have deserved it
faith we hear fearful news
for mine own part
when i said banish him i said twas pity
and so did i
and so did i and to say the truth so did very
though we willingly consented to his banishment yet
it was against our will
ye re goodly things you voices
you have made
good work you and your cry shalls to the capitol
o ay what else
these are a side that would be glad to have
this true which they so seem to fear go home
and show no sign of fear
the gods be good to us come masters lets home
i ever said we were i the wrong when we banished
him
so did we all but come lets home
i do not like this news
nor i
lets to the capitol would half my wealth
would buy this for a lie
pray let us go
do they still fly to the roman
i do not know what witchcrafts in him but
your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat
their talk at table and their thanks at end
and you are darkend in this action sir
even by your own
i cannot help it now
unless by using means i lame the foot
of our design he bears himself more proudlier
even to my person than i thought he would
in thats no changeling and i must excuse
what cannot be amended
yet i wish sir
i mean for your particularyou had not
joind in commission with him but either
had borne the action of yourself or else
to him had left it solely
i understand thee well and be thou sure
when he shall come to his account he knows not
what i can urge against him although it seems
and so he thinks and is no less apparent
to the vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly
and shows good husbandry for the volscian state
fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon
as draw his sword yet he hath left undone
that which shall break his neck or hazard mine
wheneer we come to our account
sir i beseech you think you hell carry rome
all places yield to him ere he sits down
the tribunes are no soldiers and their people
will be as rash in the repeal as hasty
to expel him thence i think hell be to rome
as is the osprey to the fish who takes it
by sovereignty of nature first he was
a noble servant to them but he could not
which out of daily fortune ever taints
the happy man whether defect of judgment
to fail in the disposing of those chances
which he was lord of or whether nature
not to be other than one thing not moving
from the casque to the cushion but commanding peace
even with the same austerity and garb
as he controlld the war but one of these
as he hath spices of them all not all
for i dare so far free himmade him feard
to choke it in the utterance so our virtues
and power unto itself most commendable
hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
to extol what it hath done
one fire drives out one fire one nail one nail
rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail
come lets away when caius rome is thine
thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine
which was sometime his general who loved him
but what o that go you that banishd him
a mile before his tent fall down and knee
to hear cominius speak ill keep at home
he would not seem to know me
do you hear
i urged our old acquaintance and the drops
that we have bled together coriolanus
he was a kind of nothing titleless
till he had forged himself a name o the fire
of burning rome
a pair of tribunes that have rackd for rome
to make coals cheapa noble memory
i minded him how royal twas to pardon
it was a bare petition of a state
to one whom they had punishd
could he say less
i offerd to awaken his regard
he could not stay to pick them in a pile
for one poor grain or two to leave unburnt
and still to nose the offence
for one poor grain or two
i am one of those his mother wife his child
you are the musty chaff and you are smelt
in this so neverneeded help yet do not
upbraids with our distress but sure if you
would be your countrys pleader your good tongue
more than the instant army we can make
might stop our countryman
no ill not meddle
pray you go to him
what should i do
only make trial what your love can do
for rome towards marcius
well and say that marcius
return me as cominius is returnd
unheard what then
but as a discontented friend griefshot
with his unkindness sayt be so
yet your good will
must have that thanks from rome after the measure
as you intended well
i think hell hear me yet to bite his lip
and hum at good cominius much unhearts me
the veins unfilld our blood is cold and then
we pout upon the morning are unapt
to give or to forgive but when we have stuffd
these and these conveyances of our blood
with wine and feeding we have suppler souls
till he be dieted to my request
and then ill set upon him
you know the very road into his kindness
and cannot lose your way
good faith ill prove him
speed how it will i shall ere long have knowledge
of my success
hell never hear him
not
i tell you he does sit in gold his eye
red as twould burn rome and his injury
the gaoler to his pity i kneeld before him
twas very faintly he said rise dismissd me
he sent in writing after me what he would not
so that all hope is vain
unless his noble mother and his wife
who as i hear mean to solicit him
for mercy to his country therefore lets hence
and with our fair entreaties haste them on
stand and go back
i am an officer of state and come
to speak with coriolanus
from whence
from rome
will no more hear from thence
youll see your rome embraced with fire before
youll speak with coriolanus
good my friends
if you have heard your general talk of rome
and of his friends there it is lots to blanks
my name hath touchd your ears it is menenius
is not here passable
i tell thee fellow
the book of his good acts whence men have read
his name unparalleld haply amplified
for i have ever verified my friends
of whom hes chief with all the size that verity
like to a bowl upon a subtle ground
i have tumbled past the throw and in his praise
i must have leave to pass
faith sir if you had told as many lies in his
behalf as you have uttered words in your own you
should not pass here no though it were as virtuous
to lie as to live chastely therefore go back
prithee fellow remember my name is menenius
always factionary on the party of your general
howsoever you have been his liar as you say you
have i am one that telling true under him must
say you cannot pass therefore go back
has he dined canst thou tell for i would not
speak with him till after dinner
you are a roman are you
i am as thy general is
then you should hate rome as he does can you
when you have pushed out your gates the very
defender of them and in a violent popular
ignorance given your enemy your shield think to
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women the virginal palms of your daughters or with
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in with
such weak breath as this no you are deceived
therefore back to rome and prepare for your
you out of reprieve and pardon
sirrah if thy captain knew i were here he would
use me with estimation
come my captain knows you not
i mean thy general
my general cares not for you back i say go lest
i let forth your halfpint of blood backthats
nay but fellow fellow
whats the matter
you shall know now that i am in estimation you shall
perceive that a jack guardant cannot office me from
with him if thou standest not i the state of
hanging or of some death more long in
spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now
presently and swoon for whats to come upon thee
the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
particular prosperity and love thee no worse than
thy old father menenius does o my son my son
thou art preparing fire for us look thee heres
water to quench it i was hardly moved to come to
thee but being assured none but myself could move
thee i have been blown out of your gates with
sighs and conjure thee to pardon rome and thy
petitionary countrymen the good gods assuage thy
wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
herethis who like a block hath denied my
access to thee
away
how away
wife mother child i know not my affairs
my revenge properly my remission lies
in volscian breasts that we have been familiar
ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather
than pity note how much therefore be gone
mine ears against your suits are stronger than
your gates against my force yet for i loved thee
take this along i writ it for thy sake
and would have rent it another word menenius
i will not hear thee speak this man aufidius
you keep a constant temper
now sir is your name menenius
way home again
do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
greatness back
what cause do you think i have to swoon
such things as you i can scarce think theres any
yere so slight he that hath a will to die by
do his worst for you be that you are long and
your misery increase with your age i say to you
as i was said to away
a noble fellow i warrant him
oak not to be windshaken
we will before the walls of rome tomorrow
set down our host my partner in this action
you must report to the volscian lords how plainly
i have borne this business
only their ends
you have respected stoppd your ears against
the general suit of rome never admitted
a private whisper no not with such friends
that thought them sure of you
this last old man
whom with a crackd heart i have sent to rome
loved me above the measure of a father
nay godded me indeed their latest refuge
was to send him for whose old love i have
though i showd sourly to him once more offerd
the first conditions which they did refuse
and cannot now accept to grace him only
that thought he could do more a very little
nor from the state nor private friends hereafter
will i lend ear to ha what shout is this
shall i be tempted to infringe my vow
in the same time tis made i will not
my wife comes foremost then the honourd mould
wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand
the grandchild to her blood but out affection
all bond and privilege of nature break
let it be virtuous to be obstinate
what is that curtsy worth or those doves eyes
which can make gods forsworn i melt and am not
of stronger earth than others my mother bows
as if olympus to a molehill should
hath an aspect of intercession which
great nature cries deny not let the volsces
be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand
as if a man were author of himself
and knew no other kin
my lord and husband
these eyes are not the same i wore in rome
the sorrow that delivers us thus changed
makes you think so
like a dull actor now
i have forgot my part and i am out
even to a full disgrace best of my flesh
forgive my tyranny but do not say
for that forgive our romans o a kiss
long as my exile sweet as my revenge
now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss
i carried from thee dear and my true lip
hath virgind it eer since you gods i prate
and the most noble mother of the world
of thy deep duty more impression show
than that of common sons
o stand up blest
whilst with no softer cushion than the flint
i kneel before thee and unproperly
show duty as mistaken all this while
between the child and parent
what is this
your knees to me to your corrected son
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds
strike the proud cedars gainst the fiery sun
murdering impossibility to make
what cannot be slight work
thou art my warrior
i holp to frame thee do you know this lady
the noble sister of publicola
the moon of rome chaste as the icicle
thats curdied by the frost from purest snow
this is a poor epitome of yours
which by the interpretation of full time
may show like all yourself
the god of soldiers
with the consent of supreme jove inform
thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove
to shame unvulnerable and stick i the wars
like a great seamark standing every flaw
and saving those that eye thee
your knee sirrah
thats my brave boy
even he your wife this lady and myself
are suitors to you
the thing i have forsworn to grant may never
be held by you denials do not bid me
dismiss my soldiers or capitulate
to ally my rages and revenges with
your colder reasons
o no more no more
you have said you will not grant us any thing
for we have nothing else to ask but that
that if you fail in our request the blame
aufidius and you volsces mark for well
hear nought from rome in private your request
should we be silent and not speak our raiment
and state of bodies would bewray what life
we have led since thy exile think with thyself
how more unfortunate than all living women
which should
make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance
with comforts
constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow
making the mother wife and child to see
the son the husband and the father tearing
his countrys bowels out and to poor we
our prayers to the gods which is a comfort
that all but we enjoy for how can we
alas how can we for our country pray
whereto we are bound together with thy victory
whereto we are bound alack or we must lose
the country our dear nurse or else thy person
our comfort in the country we must find
an evident calamity though we had
must as a foreign recreant be led
with manacles thorough our streets or else
triumphantly tread on thy countrys ruin
and bear the palm for having bravely shed
thy wife and childrens blood for myself son
i purpose not to wait on fortune till
rather to show a noble grace to both parts
than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner
march to assault thy country than to tread
trust tot thou shalt noton thy mothers womb
that brought thee to this world
ay and mine
that brought you forth this boy to keep your name
living to time
a shall not tread on me
ill run away till i am bigger but then ill fight
not of a womans tenderness to be
requires nor child nor womans face to see
i have sat too long
nay go not from us thus
if it were so that our request did tend
to save the romans thereby to destroy
the volsces whom you serve you might condemn us
may say this mercy we have showd the romans
this we received and each in either side
give the allhail to thee and cry be blest
for making up this peace thou knowst great son
the end of wars uncertain but this certain
that if thou conquer rome the benefit
which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name
whose repetition will be doggd with curses
but with his last attempt he wiped it out
destroyd his country and his name remains
thou hast affected the fine strains of honour
to imitate the graces of the gods
to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o the air
and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
that should but rive an oak why dost not speak
thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man
perhaps thy childishness will move him more
than can our reasons theres no man in the world
more bound to s mother yet here he lets me prate
like one i the stocks thou hast never in thy life
showd thy dear mother any courtesy
when she poor hen fond of no second brood
has cluckd thee to the wars and safely home
loaden with honour say my requests unjust
thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee
that thou restrainst from me the duty which
down ladies let us shame him with our knees
to his surname coriolanus longs more pride
this boy that cannot tell what he would have
but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship
does reason our petition with more strength
this fellow had a volscian to his mother
his wife is in corioli and his child
i am hushd until our city be afire
and then ill speak a little
o mother mother
what have you done behold the heavens do ope
the gods look down and this unnatural scene
they laugh at o my mother mother o
you have won a happy victory to rome
but for your sonbelieve it o believe it
most dangerously you have with him prevaild
if not most mortal to him but let it come
aufidius though i cannot make true wars
ill frame convenient peace now good aufidius
were you in my stead would you have heard
a mother less or granted less aufidius
i was moved withal
and sir it is no little thing to make
mine eyes to sweat compassion but good sir
ill not to rome ill back with you and pray you
stand to me in this cause o mother wife
ay by and by
but we will drink together and you shall bear
a better witness back than words which we
on like conditions will have counterseald
come enter with us ladies you deserve
in italy and her confederate arms
could not have made this peace
see you yond coign o the capitol yond
cornerstone
why what of that
if it be possible for you to displace it with your
little finger there is some hope the ladies of
rome especially his mother may prevail with him
sentenced and stay upon execution
ist possible that so short a time can alter the
condition of a man
there is differency between a grub and a butterfly
yet your butterfly was a grub this marcius is grown
creeping thing
he loved his mother dearly
now than an eightyearold horse the tartness
moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before
his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a
battery he sits in his state as a thing made for
alexander what he bids be done is finished with
his bidding he wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in
yes mercy if you report him truly
i paint him in the character mark what mercy his
in him than there is milk in a male tiger that
you
the gods be good unto us
no in such a case the gods will not be good unto
us when we banished him we respected not them
and he returning to break our necks they respect not us
the plebeians have got your fellowtribune
and hale him up and down all swearing if
the roman ladies bring not comfort home
theyll give him death by inches
whats the news
good news good news the ladies have prevaild
a merrier day did never yet greet rome
no not the expulsion of the tarquins
friend
art thou certain this is true is it most certain
where have you lurkd that you make doubt of it
neer through an arch so hurried the blown tide
as the recomforted through the gates why hark you
the trumpets sackbuts psalteries and fifes
tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans
make the sun dance hark you
i will go meet the ladies this volumnia
is worth of consuls senators patricians
a city full of tribunes such as you
this morning for ten thousand of your throats
id not have given a doit hark how they joy
first the gods bless you for your tidings next
accept my thankfulness
sir we have all
great cause to give great thanks
they are near the city
almost at point to enter
we will meet them
and help the joy
behold our patroness the life of rome
call all your tribes together praise the gods
unshout the noise that banishd marcius
repeal him with the welcome of his mother
cry welcome ladies welcome
welcome ladies welcome
bid them repair to the market place where i
even in theirs and in the commons ears
will vouch the truth of it him i accuse
the city ports by this hath enterd and
intends to appear before the people hoping
most welcome
how is it with our general
even so
as with a man by his own alms empoisond
and with his charity slain
most noble sir
if you do hold the same intent wherein
you wishd us parties well deliver you
of your great danger
we must proceed as we do find the people
the people will remain uncertain whilst
twixt you theres difference but the fall of either
makes the survivor heir of all
i know it
and my pretext to strike at him admits
a good construction i raised him and i pawnd
he waterd his new plants with dews of flattery
seducing so my friends and to this end
he bowd his nature never known before
but to be rough unswayable and free
sir his stoutness
when he did stand for consul which he lost
by lack of stooping
being banishd fort he came unto my hearth
made him jointservant with me gave him way
in all his own desires nay let him choose
out of my files his projects to accomplish
my best and freshest men served his designments
in mine own person holp to reap the fame
which he did end all his and took some pride
i seemd his follower not partner and
he waged me with his countenance as if
i had been mercenary
the army marvelld at it and in the last
when he had carried rome and that we lookd
for no less spoil than glory
for which my sinews shall be stretchd upon him
at a few drops of womens rheum which are
as cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour
and ill renew me in his fall but hark
your native town you enterd like a post
splitting the air with noise
and patient fools
whose children he hath slain their base throats tear
with giving him glory
therefore at your vantage
ere he express himself or move the people
with what he would say let him feel your sword
which we will second when he lies along
after your way his tale pronounced shall bury
his reasons with his body
here come the lords
you are most welcome home
i have not deserved it
but worthy lords have you with heed perused
what i have written to you
we have
and grieve to heart
what faults he made before the last i think
where he was to begin and give away
the benefit of our levies answering us
with our own charge making a treaty where
there was a yieldingthis admits no excuse
hail lords i am returnd your soldier
no more infected with my countrys love
than when i parted hence but still subsisting
under your great command you are to know
that prosperously i have attempted and
with bloody passage led your wars even to
the gates of rome our spoils we have brought home
do more than counterpoise a full third part
the charges of the action we have made peace
with no less honour to the antiates
subscribed by the consuls and patricians
together with the seal o the senate what
we have compounded on
read it not noble lords
but tell the traitor in the highst degree
he hath abused your powers
traitor how now
ay traitor marcius
marcius
ill grace thee with that robbery thy stoln name
coriolanus in corioli
you lords and heads o the state perfidiously
he has betrayd your business and given up
for certain drops of salt your city rome
i say your city to his wife and mother
breaking his oath and resolution like
a twist of rotten silk never admitting
counsel o the war but at his nurses tears
he whined and roard away your victory
that pages blushd at him and men of heart
lookd wondering each at other
hearst thou mars
name not the god thou boy of tears
ha
no more
measureless liar thou hast made my heart
too great for what contains it boy o slave
pardon me lords tis the first time that ever
i was forced to scold your judgments my grave lords
who wears my stripes impressd upon him that
must bear my beating to his graveshall join
to thrust the lie unto him
peace both and hear me speak
cut me to pieces volsces men and lads
stain all your edges on me boy false hound
if you have writ your annals true tis there
that like an eagle in a dovecote i
alone i did it boy
why noble lords
will you be put in mind of his blind fortune
which was your shame by this unholy braggart
fore your own eyes and ears
let him die fort
tear him to pieces do it presently he killd
my son my daughter he killed my cousin
marcus he killed my father
the man is noble and his fame foldsin
this orb o the earth his last offences to us

o that i had him
with six aufidiuses or more his tribe
to use my lawful sword
insolent villain

provoked by him you cannotthe great danger
which this mans life did owe you youll rejoice
that he is thus cut off please it your honours
to call me to your senate ill deliver
myself your loyal servant or endure
your heaviest censure

as the most noble corse that ever herald
did follow to his urn
his own impatience
takes from aufidius a great part of blame
lets make the best of it
my rage is gone
and i am struck with sorrow take him up
help three o the chiefest soldiers ill be one
trail your steel pikes though in this city he
hath widowd and unchilded many a one
which to this hour bewail the injury
yet he shall have a noble memory assist
now is the winter of our discontent
made glorious summer by this sun of york
and all the clouds that lourd upon our house
in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
our bruised arms hung up for monuments
our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
our dreadful marches to delightful measures
grimvisaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
and now instead of mounting barded steeds
to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks
nor made to court an amorous lookingglass
i that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty
to strut before a wanton ambling nymph
i that am curtaild of this fair proportion
cheated of feature by dissembling nature
deformed unfinishd sent before my time
into this breathing world scarce half made up
and that so lamely and unfashionable
that dogs bark at me as i halt by them
why i in this weak piping time of peace
have no delight to pass away the time
unless to spy my shadow in the sun
and therefore since i cannot prove a lover
to entertain these fair wellspoken days
i am determined to prove a villain
and hate the idle pleasures of these days
plots have i laid inductions dangerous
by drunken prophecies libels and dreams
to set my brother clarence and the king
and if king edward be as true and just
as i am subtle false and treacherous
this day should clarence closely be mewd up
about a prophecy which says that g
of edwards heirs the murderer shall be
clarence comes
brother good day what means this armed guard
that waits upon your grace
his majesty
tendering my persons safety hath appointed
this conduct to convey me to the tower
upon what cause
because my name is george
alack my lord that fault is none of yours
o belike his majesty hath some intent
that you shall be newchristend in the tower
but whats the matter clarence  may i know
yea richard when i know for i protest
he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
and from the crossrow plucks the letter g
and says a wizard told him that by g
his issue disinherited should be
and for my name of george begins with g
it follows in his thought that i am he
these as i learn and such like toys as these
have moved his highness to commit me now
my lady grey his wife clarence tis she
that tempers him to this extremity
was it not she and that good man of worship
anthony woodville her brother there
that made him send lord hastings to the tower
from whence this present day he is deliverd
we are not safe clarence we are not safe
by heaven i think theres no man is secure
but the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds
that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
heard ye not what an humble suppliant
lord hastings was to her for his delivery
humbly complaining to her deity
got my lord chamberlain his liberty
ill tell you what i think it is our way
if we will keep in favour with the king
the jealous oerworn widow and herself
since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen
are mighty gossips in this monarchy
i beseech your graces both to pardon me
his majesty hath straitly given in charge
that no man shall have private conference
of what degree soever with his brother
even so ant please your worship brakenbury
is wise and virtuous and his noble queen
well struck in years fair and not jealous
we say that shores wife hath a pretty foot
a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue
how say you sir can you deny all this
with this my lord myself have nought to do
naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow
he that doth naught with her excepting one
were best he do it secretly alone
what one my lord
i beseech your grace to pardon me and withal
forbear your conference with the noble duke
we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey
we are the queens abjects and must obey
and whatsoever you will employ me in
were it to call king edwards widow sister
i will perform it to enfranchise you
meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood
touches me deeper than you can imagine
i know it pleaseth neither of us well
well your imprisonment shall not be long
meantime have patience
i must perforce farewell
go tread the path that thou shalt neer return
simple plain clarence i do love thee so
that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven
if heaven will take the present at our hands
but who comes here the newdeliverd hastings
good time of day unto my gracious lord
as much unto my good lord chamberlain
well are you welcome to the open air
how hath your lordship brookd imprisonment
but i shall live my lord to give them thanks
that were the cause of my imprisonment
no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too
for they that were your enemies are his
and have prevaild as much on him as you
more pity that the eagle should be mewd
while kites and buzzards prey at liberty
what news abroad
no news so bad abroad as this at home
the king is sickly weak and melancholy
and his physicians fear him mightily
now by saint paul this news is bad indeed
o he hath kept an evil diet long
tis very grievous to be thought upon
what is he in his bed
he is
go you before and i will follow you
he cannot live i hope and must not die
till george be packd with posthorse up to heaven
ill in to urge his hatred more to clarence
with lies well steeld with weighty arguments
and if i fall not in my deep intent
which done god take king edward to his mercy
and leave the world for me to bustle in
for then ill marry warwicks youngest daughter
what though i killd her husband and her father
the readiest way to make the wench amends
the which will i not all so much for love
as for another secret close intent
by marrying her which i must reach unto
when they are gone then must i count my gains
set down set down your honourable load
if honour may be shrouded in a hearse
whilst i awhile obsequiously lament
the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
poor keycold figure of a holy king
pale ashes of the house of lancaster
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood
be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost
to hear the lamentations of poor anne
wife to thy edward to thy slaughterd son
stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
lo in these windows that let forth thy life
i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes
cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
more direful hap betide that hated wretch
that makes us wretched by the death of thee
than i can wish to adders spiders toads
or any creeping venomd thing that lives
if ever he have child abortive be it
prodigious and untimely brought to light
whose ugly and unnatural aspect
may fright the hopeful mother at the view
and that be heir to his unhappiness
if ever he have wife let her he made
a miserable by the death of him
as i am made by my poor lord and thee
come now towards chertsey with your holy load
taken from pauls to be interred there
and still as you are weary of the weight
rest you whiles i lament king henrys corse
stay you that bear the corse and set it down
what black magician conjures up this fiend
to stop devoted charitable deeds
villains set down the corse or by saint paul
ill make a corse of him that disobeys
my lord stand back and let the coffin pass
advance thy halbert higher than my breast
or by saint paul ill strike thee to my foot
and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
what do you tremble are you all afraid
alas i blame you not for you are mortal
and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell
thou hadst but power over his mortal body
his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
sweet saint for charity be not so curst
foul devil for gods sake hence and trouble us not
for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell
filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
behold this pattern of thy butcheries
o gentlemen see see dead henrys wounds
open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh
blush blush thou lump of foul deformity
for tis thy presence that exhales this blood
from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
thy deed inhuman and unnatural
provokes this deluge most unnatural
o god which this blood madest revenge his death
o earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death
either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead
or earth gape open wide and eat him quick
as thou dost swallow up this good kings blood
which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered
lady you know no rules of charity
which renders good for bad blessings for curses
no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
but i know none and therefore am no beast
o wonderful when devils tell the truth
more wonderful when angels are so angry
vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman
of these supposedevils to give me leave
by circumstance but to acquit myself
vouchsafe defused infection of a man
for these known evils but to give me leave
by circumstance to curse thy cursed self
fairer than tongue can name thee let me have
some patient leisure to excuse myself
fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make
no excuse current but to hang thyself
by such despair i should accuse myself
and by despairing shouldst thou stand excused
for doing worthy vengeance on thyself
which didst unworthy slaughter upon others
say that i slew them not
but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
i did not kill your husband
why then he is alive
nay he is dead and slain by edwards hand
thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood
the which thou once didst bend against her breast
but that thy brothers beat aside the point
i was provoked by her slanderous tongue
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
didst thou not kill this king
i grant ye
dost grant me hedgehog then god grant me too
thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
o he was gentle mild and virtuous
the fitter for the king of heaven that hath him
he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
let him thank me that holp to send him thither
for he was fitter for that place than earth
and thou unfit for any place but hell
yes one place else if you will hear me name it
some dungeon
your bedchamber
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
so will it madam till i lie with you
i hope so
i know so but gentle lady anne
to leave this keen encounter of our wits
and fall somewhat into a slower method
is not the causer of the timeless deaths
of these plantagenets henry and edward
as blameful as the executioner
thou art the cause and most accursed effect
your beauty was the cause of that effect
to undertake the death of all the world
so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom
if i thought that i tell thee homicide
these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
these eyes could never endure sweet beautys wreck
as all the world is cheered by the sun
so i by that it is my day my life
black night oershade thy day and death thy life
curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
i would i were to be revenged on thee
it is a quarrel most unnatural
to be revenged on him that loveth you
it is a quarrel just and reasonable
to be revenged on him that slew my husband
he that bereft thee lady of thy husband
did it to help thee to a better husband
his better doth not breathe upon the earth
he lives that loves thee better than he could
name him
plantagenet
why that was he
the selfsame name but one of better nature
where is he
here
why dost thou spit at me
would it were mortal poison for thy sake
never came poison from so sweet a place
never hung poison on a fouler toad
out of my sight thou dost infect my eyes
thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
i would they were that i might die at once
for now they kill me with a living death
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
these eyes that never shed remorseful tear
no when my father york and edward wept
to hear the piteous moan that rutland made
when blackfaced clifford shook his sword at him
nor when thy warlike father like a child
told the sad story of my fathers death
and twenty times made pause to sob and weep
that all the standersby had wet their cheeks
my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
and what these sorrows could not thence exhale
thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
i never sued to friend nor enemy
my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
but now thy beauty is proposed my fee
my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
teach not thy lips such scorn for they were made
for kissing lady not for such contempt
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword
which if thou please to hide in this true bosom
and let the soul forth that adoreth thee
i lay it naked to the deadly stroke
and humbly beg the death upon my knee
nay do not pause for i did kill king henry
but twas thy beauty that provoked me
nay now dispatch twas i that stabbd young edward
but twas thy heavenly face that set me on
take up the sword again or take up me
i will not be the executioner
then bid me kill myself and i will do it
i have already
speak it again and even with the word
that hand which for thy love did kill thy love
shall for thy love kill a far truer love
to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary
i would i knew thy heart
tis figured in my tongue
i fear me both are false
then never man was true
well well put up your sword
say then my peace is made
that shall you know hereafter
but shall i live in hope
all men i hope live so
vouchsafe to wear this ring
to take is not to give
look how this ring encompasseth finger
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
wear both of them for both of them are thine
and if thy poor devoted suppliant may
but beg one favour at thy gracious hand
thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
what is it
that it would please thee leave these sad designs
to him that hath more cause to be a mourner
and presently repair to crosby place
where after i have solemnly interrd
at chertsey monastery this noble king
and wet his grave with my repentant tears
for divers unknown reasons i beseech you
grant me this boon
with all my heart and much it joys me too
to see you are become so penitent
tressel and berkeley go along with me
bid me farewell
tis more than you deserve
but since you teach me how to flatter you
imagine i have said farewell already
sirs take up the corse
towards chertsey noble lord
no to whitefriars there attend my coining
was ever woman in this humour wood
was ever woman in this humour won
ill have her but i will not keep her long
what i that killd her husband and his father
to take her in her hearts extremest hate
with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes
the bleeding witness of her hatred by
having god her conscience and these bars
against me
and i nothing to back my suit at all
but the plain devil and dissembling looks
and yet to win her all the world to nothing
ha
hath she forgot already that brave prince
edward her lord whom i some three months since
stabbd in my angry mood at tewksbury
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman
framed in the prodigality of nature
young valiant wise and no doubt right royal
the spacious world cannot again afford
and will she yet debase her eyes on me
that croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince
and made her widow to a woful bed
on me whose all not equals edwards moiety
on me that halt and am unshapen thus
my dukedom to a beggarly denier
upon my life she finds although i cannot
myself to be a marvellous proper man
ill be at charges for a lookingglass
and entertain some score or two of tailors
since i am crept in favour with myself
will maintain it with some little cost
but first ill turn yon fellow in his grave
and then return lamenting to my love
shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass
that i may see my shadow as i pass
will soon recover his accustomd health
therefore for gods sake entertain good comfort
and cheer his grace with quick and merry words
if he were dead what would betide of me
no other harm but loss of such a lord
the loss of such a lord includes all harm
the heavens have blessd you with a goodly son
to be your comforter when he is gone
oh he is young and his minority
is put unto the trust of richard gloucester
a man that loves not me nor none of you
is it concluded that he shall be protector
but so it must be if the king miscarry
here come the lords of buckingham and derby
good time of day unto your royal grace
god make your majesty joyful as you have been
the countess richmond good my lord of derby
to your good prayers will scarcely say amen
yet derby notwithstanding shes your wife
and loves not me be you good lord assured
i hate not you for her proud arrogance
i do beseech you either not believe
the envious slanders of her false accusers
or if she be accused in true report
bear with her weakness which i think proceeds
from wayward sickness and no grounded malice
saw you the king today my lord of derby
but now the duke of buckingham and i
are come from visiting his majesty
what likelihood of his amendment lords
madam good hope his grace speaks cheerfully
god grant him health did you confer with him
betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers
and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain
and sent to warn them to his royal presence
would all were well but that will never be
i fear our happiness is at the highest
who are they that complain unto the king
that i forsooth am stern and love them not
by holy paul they love his grace but lightly
that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
because i cannot flatter and speak fair
smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog
duck with french nods and apish courtesy
i must be held a rancorous enemy
cannot a plain man live and think no harm
but thus his simple truth must be abused
by silken sly insinuating jacks
to whom in all this presence speaks your grace
to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
when have i injured thee when done thee wrong
or thee or thee or any of your faction
a plague upon you all his royal person
whom god preserve better than you would wish
cannot be quiet scarce a breathingwhile
but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
brother of gloucester you mistake the matter
the king of his own royal disposition
and not provoked by any suitor else
aiming belike at your interior hatred
which in your outward actions shows itself
against my kindred brothers and myself
makes him to send that thereby he may gather
the ground of your illwill and so remove it
since every jack became a gentleman
theres many a gentle person made a jack
come come we know your meaning brother
gloucester
god grant we never may have need of you
your brother is imprisond by your means
myself disgraced and the nobility
held in contempt whilst many fair promotions
are daily given to ennoble those
that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
by him that raised me to this careful height
from that contented hap which i enjoyd
i never did incense his majesty
against the duke of clarence but have been
an earnest advocate to plead for him
my lord you do me shameful injury
falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
you may deny that you were not the cause
of my lord hastings late imprisonment
she may my lord for
she may lord rivers why who knows not so
she may help you to many fair preferments
and then deny her aiding hand therein
and lay those honours on your high deserts
what may she not she may yea marry may she
what marry may she
what marry may she marry with a king
i wis your grandam had a worser match
my lord of gloucester i have too long borne
by heaven i will acquaint his majesty
with those gross taunts i often have endured
i had rather be a country servantmaid
than a great queen with this condition
small joy have i in being englands queen
and lessend be that small god i beseech thee
thy honour state and seat is due to me
what threat you me with telling of the king
i dare adventure to be sent to the tower
tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot
thou slewest my husband henry in the tower
and edward my poor son at tewksbury
ere you were queen yea or your husband king
i was a packhorse in his great affairs
a weederout of his proud adversaries
to royalize his blood i spilt mine own
yea and much better blood than his or thine
in all which time you and your husband grey
were factious for the house of lancaster
and rivers so were you was not your husband
in margarets battle at saint albans slain
let me put in your minds if you forget
what you have been ere now and what you are
withal what i have been and what i am
a murderous villain and so still thou art
poor clarence did forsake his father warwick
yea and forswore himselfwhich jesu pardon
which god revenge
to fight on edwards party for the crown
and for his meed poor lord he is mewd up
i would to god my heart were flint like edwards
or edwards soft and pitiful like mine
i am too childishfoolish for this world
hie thee to hell for shame and leave the world
thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is
my lord of gloucester in those busy days
which here you urge to prove us enemies
so should we you if you should be our king
far be it from my heart the thought of it
as little joy my lord as you suppose
you should enjoy were you this countrys king
as little joy may you suppose in me
that i enjoy being the queen thereof
a little joy enjoys the queen thereof
for i am she and altogether joyless
i can no longer hold me patient
hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out
in sharing that which you have pilld from me
which of you trembles not that looks on me
if not that i being queen you bow like subjects
yet that by you deposed you quake like rebels
o gentle villain do not turn away
foul wrinkled witch what makest thou in my sight
but repetition of what thou hast marrd
that will i make before i let thee go
wert thou not banished on pain of death
i was but i do find more pain in banishment
than death can yield me here by my abode
a husband and a son thou owest to me
the sorrow that i have by right is yours
and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
the curse my noble father laid on thee
when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
and with thy scorns drewst rivers from his eyes
and then to dry them gavest the duke a clout
steepd in the faultless blood of pretty rutland
his curses then from bitterness of soul
denounced against thee are all falln upon thee
and god not we hath plagued thy bloody deed
so just is god to right the innocent
o twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
and the most merciless that eer was heard of
tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
no man but prophesied revenge for it
northumberland then present wept to see it
what were you snarling all before i came
ready to catch each other by the throat
and turn you all your hatred now on me
did yorks dread curse prevail so much with heaven
that henrys death my lovely edwards death
their kingdoms loss my woful banishment
could all but answer for that peevish brat
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses
if not by war by surfeit die your king
as ours by murder to make him a king
edward thy son which now is prince of wales
for edward my son which was prince of wales
die in his youth by like untimely violence
thyself a queen for me that was a queen
outlive thy glory like my wretched self
long mayst thou live to wail thy childrens loss
and see another as i see thee now
deckd in thy rights as thou art stalld in mine
long die thy happy days before thy death
and after many lengthend hours of grief
die neither mother wife nor englands queen
rivers and dorset you were standers by
and so wast thou lord hastings when my son
that none of you may live your natural age
but by some unlookd accident cut off
have done thy charm thou hateful witherd hag
and leave out thee stay dog for thou shalt hear me
if heaven have any grievous plague in store
exceeding those that i can wish upon thee
o let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
and then hurl down their indignation
on thee the troubler of the poor worlds peace
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest
and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine
unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils
thou elvishmarkd abortive rooting hog
thou that wast seald in thy nativity
the slave of nature and the son of hell
thou slander of thy mothers heavy womb
thou loathed issue of thy fathers loins
thou rag of honour thou detested
margaret
richard
ha
i call thee not
i cry thee mercy then for i had thought
that thou hadst calld me all these bitter names
why so i did but lookd for no reply
o let me make the period to my curse
tis done by me and ends in margaret
thus have you breathed your curse against yourself
poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune
why strewst thou sugar on that bottled spider
whose deadly web ensnareth thee about
fool fool thou whetst a knife to kill thyself
the time will come when thou shalt wish for me
to help thee curse that poisonous bunchbackd toad
falseboding woman end thy frantic curse
lest to thy harm thou move our patience
foul shame upon you you have all moved mine
were you well served you would be taught your duty
to serve me well you all should do me duty
o serve me well and teach yourselves that duty
dispute not with her she is lunatic
your firenew stamp of honour is scarce current
o that your young nobility could judge
what twere to lose it and be miserable
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them
and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
it toucheth you my lord as much as me
our aery buildeth in the cedars top
and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun
and turns the sun to shade alas alas
witness my son now in the shade of death
whose bright outshining beams thy cloudy wrath
hath in eternal darkness folded up
your aery buildeth in our aerys nest
o god that seest it do not suffer it
as it was won with blood lost be it so
have done for shame if not for charity
uncharitably with me have you dealt
and shamefully by you my hopes are butcherd
my charity is outrage life my shame
and in that shame still live my sorrows rage
have done have done
o princely buckingham ill kiss thy hand
now fair befal thee and thy noble house
thy garments are not spotted with our blood
nor thou within the compass of my curse
nor no one here for curses never pass
the lips of those that breathe them in the air
ill not believe but they ascend the sky
and there awake gods gentlesleeping peace
o buckingham take heed of yonder dog
look when he fawns he bites and when he bites
have not to do with him beware of him
sin death and hell have set their marks on him
and all their ministers attend on him
what doth she say my lord of buckingham
nothing that i respect my gracious lord
what dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel
and soothe the devil that i warn thee from
o but remember this another day
when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
and say poor margaret was a prophetess
live each of you the subjects to his hate
and he to yours and all of you to gods
my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses
she hath had too much wrong and i repent
my part thereof that i have done to her
i never did her any to my knowledge
but you have all the vantage of her wrong
i was too hot to do somebody good
that is too cold in thinking of it now
marry as for clarence he is well repaid
he is frankd up to fatting for his pains
god pardon them that are the cause of it
a virtuous and a christianlike conclusion
to pray for them that have done scathe to us
being welladvised
for had i cursed now i had cursed myself
madam his majesty doth call for you
and for your grace and you my noble lords
catesby we come lords will you go with us
madam we will attend your grace
i do the wrong and first begin to brawl
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach
i lay unto the grievous charge of others
clarence whom i indeed have laid in darkness
i do beweep to many simple gulls
namely to hastings derby buckingham
and say it is the queen and her allies
that stir the king against the duke my brother
now they believe it and withal whet me
but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture
and thus i clothe my naked villany
with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ
and seem a saint when most i play the devil
but soft here come my executioners
how now my hardy stout resolved mates
are you now going to dispatch this deed
we are my lord and come to have the warrant
that we may be admitted where he is
well thought upon i have it here about me
when you have done repair to crosby place
but sirs be sudden in the execution
withal obdurate do not hear him plead
for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps
may move your hearts to pity if you mark him
tush
fear not my lord we will not stand to prate
we come to use our hands and not our tongues
i like you lads about your business straight
go go dispatch
we will my noble lord
why looks your grace so heavily today
o i have passd a miserable night
so full of ugly sights of ghastly dreams
that as i am a christian faithful man
i would not spend another such a night
though twere to buy a world of happy days
so full of dismal terror was the time
what was your dream i long to hear you tell it
methoughts that i had broken from the tower
and was embarkd to cross to burgundy
and in my company my brother gloucester
who from my cabin tempted me to walk
and cited up a thousand fearful times
during the wars of york and lancaster
that had befalln us as we paced along
upon the giddy footing of the hatches
methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling
struck me that thought to stay him overboard
into the tumbling billows of the main
lord lord methought what pain it was to drown
what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears
what ugly sights of death within mine eyes
methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks
ten thousand men that fishes gnawd upon
wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl
inestimable stones unvalued jewels
some lay in dead mens skulls and in those holes
where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems
which wood the slimy bottom of the deep
and mockd the dead bones that lay scatterd by
had you such leisure in the time of death
to gaze upon the secrets of the deep
methought i had and often did i strive
kept in my soul and would not let it forth
to seek the empty vast and wandering air
but smotherd it within my panting bulk
which almost burst to belch it in the sea
awaked you not with this sore agony
o no my dream was lengthend after life
o then began the tempest to my soul
who passd methought the melancholy flood
with that grim ferryman which poets write of
unto the kingdom of perpetual night
the first that there did greet my stranger soul
was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick
who cried aloud what scourge for perjury
can this dark monarchy afford false clarence
a shadow like an angel with bright hair
dabbled in blood and he squeakd out aloud
clarence is come false fleeting perjured clarence
that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury
seize on him furies take him to your torments
with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends
environd me about and howled in mine ears
such hideous cries that with the very noise
i trembling waked and for a season after
could not believe but that i was in hell
such terrible impression made the dream
no marvel my lord though it affrighted you
i promise i am afraid to hear you tell it
o brakenbury i have done those things
which now bear evidence against my soul
for edwards sake and see how he requites me
o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds
yet execute thy wrath in me alone
o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
i pray thee gentle keeper stay by me
my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
makes the night morning and the noontide night
princes have but their tides for their glories
an outward honour for an inward toil
and for unfelt imagination
so that betwixt their tides and low names
theres nothing differs but the outward fame
ho whos here
in gods name what are you and how came you hither
i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs
yea are you so brief
o sir it is better to be brief than tedious show
him our commission talk no more
i am in this commanded to deliver
i will not reason what is meant hereby
because i will be guiltless of the meaning
ill to the king and signify to him
that thus i have resignd my charge to you
what shall we stab him as he sleeps
no then he will say twas done cowardly when he wakes
when he wakes why fool he shall never wake till
the judgmentday
why then he will say we stabbed him sleeping
the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind
of remorse in me
what art thou afraid
not to kill him having a warrant for it but to be
damned for killing him from which no warrant can defend us
i thought thou hadst been resolute
so i am to let him live
back to the duke of gloucester tell him so
will change twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty
how dost thou feel thyself now
faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me
remember our reward when the deed is done
where is thy conscience now
in the duke of gloucesters purse
so when he opens his purse to give us our reward
thy conscience flies out
let it go theres few or none will entertain it
how if it come to thee again
accuseth him he cannot swear but it cheques him
he cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it
mutinies in a mans bosom it fills one full of
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it
zounds it is even now at my elbow persuading me
not to kill the duke
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh
tut i am strongframed he cannot prevail with me
i warrant thee
spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation come shall we to this gear
take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword and then we will chop him in the malmseybutt
in the next room
o excellent devise make a sop of him
no first lets reason with him
where art thou keeper give me a cup of wine
you shall have wine enough my lord anon
in gods name what art thou
a man as you are
but not as i am royal
nor you as we are loyal
thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
my voice is now the kings my looks mine own
how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
who sent you hither wherefore do you come
to to to
to murder me
ay ay
you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
wherein my friends have i offended you
offended us you have not but the king
i shall be reconciled to him again
never my lord therefore prepare to die
are you calld forth from out a world of men
to slay the innocent what is my offence
where are the evidence that do accuse me
what lawful quest have given their verdict up
unto the frowning judge or who pronounced
the bitter sentence of poor clarence death
before i be convict by course of law
to threaten me with death is most unlawful
i charge you as you hope to have redemption
by christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins
that you depart and lay no hands on me
the deed you undertake is damnable
what we will do we do upon command
and he that hath commanded is the king
erroneous vassal the great king of kings
hath in the tables of his law commanded
spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans
take heed for he holds vengeance in his hands
to hurl upon their heads that break his law
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee
thou didst receive the holy sacrament
to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster
and like a traitor to the name of god
didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade
unripdst the bowels of thy sovereigns son
whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend
how canst thou urge gods dreadful law to us
when thou hast broke it in so dear degree
alas for whose sake did i that ill deed
he sends ye not to murder me for this
for in this sin he is as deep as i
if god will be revenged for this deed
o know you yet he doth it publicly
take not the quarrel from his powerful arm
he needs no indirect nor lawless course
to cut off those that have offended him
who made thee then a bloody minister
when gallantspringing brave plantagenet
that princely novice was struck dead by thee
my brothers love the devil and my rage
thy brothers love our duty and thy fault
provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
oh if you love my brother hate not me
i am his brother and i love him well
if you be hired for meed go back again
and i will send you to my brother gloucester
who shall reward you better for my life
than edward will for tidings of my death
you are deceived your brother gloucester hates you
go you to him from me
ay so we will
tell him when that our princely father york
blessd his three sons with his victorious arm
and charged us from his soul to love each other
bid gloucester think of this and he will weep
ay millstones as be lessond us to weep
o do not slander him for he is kind
right
tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee
it cannot be for when i parted with him
he huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs
that he would labour my delivery
why so he doth now he delivers thee
from this worlds thraldom to the joys of heaven
make peace with god for you must die my lord
hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul
to counsel me to make my peace with god
and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind
that thou wilt war with god by murdering me
ah sirs consider he that set you on
to do this deed will hate you for the deed
what shall we do
relent and save your souls
relent tis cowardly and womanish
not to relent is beastly savage devilish
which of you if you were a princes son
being pent from liberty as i am now
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you
would not entreat for life
o if thine eye be not a flatterer
come thou on my side and entreat for me
as you would beg were you in my distress
a begging prince what beggar pities not
look behind you my lord
ill drown you in the malmseybutt within
a bloody deed and desperately dispatchd
how fain like pilate would i wash my hands
of this most grievous guilty murder done
how now what meanst thou that thou helpst me not
by heavens the duke shall know how slack thou art
i would he knew that i had saved his brother
take thou the fee and tell him what i say
for i repent me that the duke is slain
now must i hide his body in some hole
and when i have my meed i must away
for this will out and here i must not stay
i every day expect an embassage
from my redeemer to redeem me hence
and now in peace my soul shall part to heaven
since i have set my friends at peace on earth
rivers and hastings take each others hand
dissemble not your hatred swear your love
and with my hand i seal my true hearts love
so thrive i as i truly swear the like
take heed you dally not before your king
lest he that is the supreme king of kings
confound your hidden falsehood and award
either of you to be the others end
so prosper i as i swear perfect love
and i as i love hastings with my heart
madam yourself are not exempt in this
nor your son dorset buckingham nor you
you have been factious one against the other
wife love lord hastings let him kiss your hand
and what you do do it unfeignedly
here hastings i will never more remember
our former hatred so thrive i and mine
dorset embrace him hastings love lord marquess
this interchange of love i here protest
upon my part shall be unviolable
and so swear i my lord
now princely buckingham seal thou this league
with thy embracements to my wifes allies
and make me happy in your unity
whenever buckingham doth turn his hate
on you or yours
but with all duteous love
doth cherish you and yours god punish me
with hate in those where i expect most love
when i have most need to employ a friend
and most assured that he is a friend
deep hollow treacherous and full of guile
be he unto me this do i beg of god
when i am cold in zeal to yours
a pleasing cordial princely buckingham
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart
there wanteth now our brother gloucester here
to make the perfect period of this peace
and in good time here comes the noble duke
and princely peers a happy time of day
happy indeed as we have spent the day
brother we done deeds of charity
made peace enmity fair love of hate
between these swelling wrongincensed peers
amongst this princely heap if any here
by false intelligence or wrong surmise
hold me a foe
if i unwittingly or in my rage
have aught committed that is hardly borne
by any in this presence i desire
tis death to me to be at enmity
i hate it and desire all good mens love
first madam i entreat true peace of you
which i will purchase with my duteous service
of you my noble cousin buckingham
if ever any grudge were lodged between us
of you lord rivers and lord grey of you
that without desert have frownd on me
dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all
i do not know that englishman alive
with whom my soul is any jot at odds
more than the infant that is born tonight
i thank my god for my humility
i would to god all strifes were well compounded
my sovereign liege i do beseech your majesty
to take our brother clarence to your grace
why madam have i offerd love for this
to be so bouted in this royal presence
who knows not that the noble duke is dead
you do him injury to scorn his corse
who knows not he is dead who knows he is
all seeing heaven what a world is this
look i so pale lord dorset as the rest
ay my good lord and no one in this presence
but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
is clarence dead the order was reversed
but he poor soul by your first order died
some tardy cripple bore the countermand
that came too lag to see him buried
god grant that some less noble and less loyal
nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood
deserve not worse than wretched clarence did
and yet go current from suspicion
a boon my sovereign for my service done
i will not rise unless your highness grant
then speak at once what is it thou demandst
the forfeit sovereign of my servants life
who slew today a righteous gentleman
lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
have a tongue to doom my brothers death
and shall the same give pardon to a slave
my brother slew no man his fault was thought
and yet his punishment was cruel death
who sued to me for him who in my rage
kneeld at my feet and bade me be advised
who spake of brotherhood who spake of love
who told me how the poor soul did forsake
the mighty warwick and did fight for me
who told me in the field by tewksbury
when oxford had me down he rescued me
and said dear brother live and be a king
who told me when we both lay in the field
frozen almost to death how he did lap me
even in his own garments and gave himself
all thin and naked to the numb cold night
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath
sinfully pluckd and not a man of you
had so much grace to put it in my mind
but when your carters or your waitingvassals
have done a drunken slaughter and defaced
the precious image of our dear redeemer
you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon
and i unjustly too must grant it you
but for my brother not a man would speak
nor i ungracious speak unto myself
for him poor soul the proudest of you all
have been beholding to him in his life
yet none of you would once plead for his life
o god i fear thy justice will take hold
on me and you and mine and yours for this
come hastings help me to my closet
oh poor clarence
this is the fruit of rashness markd you not
how that the guilty kindred of the queen
lookd pale when they did hear of clarence death
o they did urge it still unto the king
god will revenge it but come let us in
to comfort edward with our company
we wait upon your grace
tell me good grandam is our father dead
no boy
why do you wring your hands and beat your breast
and cry o clarence my unhappy son
why do you look on us and shake your head
and call us wretches orphans castaways
if that our noble father be alive
my pretty cousins you mistake me much
i do lament the sickness of the king
as loath to lose him not your fathers death
it were lost sorrow to wail one thats lost
then grandam you conclude that he is dead
god will revenge it whom i will importune
with daily prayers all to that effect
and so will i
incapable and shallow innocents
you cannot guess who caused your fathers death
grandam we can for my good uncle gloucester
told me the king provoked by the queen
and when my uncle told me so he wept
and huggd me in his arm and kindly kissd my cheek
bade me rely on him as on my father
and he would love me dearly as his child
oh that deceit should steal such gentle shapes
and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile
he is my son yea and therein my shame
yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
think you my uncle did dissemble grandam
ay boy
i cannot think it hark what noise is this
oh who shall hinder me to wail and weep
to chide my fortune and torment myself
ill join with black despair against my soul
and to myself become an enemy
what means this scene of rude impatience
edward my lord your son our king is dead
why grow the branches now the root is witherd
why wither not the leaves the sap being gone
if you will live lament if die be brief
that our swiftwinged souls may catch the kings
or like obedient subjects follow him
to his new kingdom of perpetual rest
ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow
as i had title in thy noble husband
i have bewept a worthy husbands death
but now two mirrors of his princely semblance
are crackd in pieces by malignant death
and i for comfort have but one false glass
which grieves me when i see my shame in him
thou art a widow yet thou art a mother
but death hath snatchd my husband from mine arms
and pluckd two crutches from my feeble limbs
edward and clarence o what cause have i
thine being but a moiety of my grief
to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries
good aunt you wept not for our fathers death
how can we aid you with our kindred tears
our fatherless distress was left unmoand
your widowdolour likewise be unwept
give me no help in lamentation
i am not barren to bring forth complaints
all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes
that i being governd by the watery moon
may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
oh for my husband for my dear lord edward
oh for our father for our dear lord clarence
alas for both both mine edward and clarence
what stay had i but edward and hes gone
what stay had we but clarence and hes gone
what stays had i but they and they are gone
was never widow had so dear a loss
were never orphans had so dear a loss
was never mother had so dear a loss
alas i am the mother of these moans
their woes are parcelld mine are general
she for an edward weeps and so do i
these babes for clarence weep and so do i
alas you three on me threefold distressd
pour all your tears i am your sorrows nurse
and i will pamper it with lamentations
in common worldly things tis calld ungrateful
with dull unwilligness to repay a debt
which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
much more to be thus opposite with heaven
for it requires the royal debt it lent you
madam bethink you like a careful mother
drown desperate sorrow in dead edwards grave
and plant your joys in living edwards throne
to wail the dimming of our shining star
but none can cure their harms by wailing them
madam my mother i do cry you mercy
i crave your blessing
god bless thee and put meekness in thy mind
love charity obedience and true duty
you cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers
that bear this mutual heavy load of moan
now cheer each other in each others love
though we have spent our harvest of this king
we are to reap the harvest of his son
the broken rancour of your highswoln hearts
but lately splinterd knit and joind together
me seemeth good that with some little train
forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetchd
hither to london to be crownd our king
why with some little train my lord of buckingham
marry my lord lest by a multitude
the newheald wound of malice should break out
which would be so much the more dangerous
where every horse bears his commanding rein
and may direct his course as please himself
as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
in my opinion ought to be prevented
i hope the king made peace with all of us
and the compact is firm and true in me
yet since it is but green it should be put
